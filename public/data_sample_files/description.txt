super simple place but amazing nonetheless
its been around since the 30s and they still serve the same thing they started with a bologna and salami sandwich with mustard
small unassuming place that changes their menu every so often
cool decor and vibe inside their 30 seat restaurant
call for a reservation
lesters is located in a beautiful neighborhood and has been there since 1951
they are known for smoked meat which most delis have but their brisket sandwich is what i come to montreal for
theyve got about 12 seats outside to go along with the inside
love coming here
yes the place always needs the floor swept but when you give out  peanuts in the shell how wont it always be a bit dirty
had their chocolate almond croissant and it was amazing
so light and buttery and oh my how chocolaty
who would have guess that you would be able to get fairly decent vietnamese restaurant in east york
always drove past this coffee house and wondered about it
bf and i finally made the stop to try this place out
this is currently my parents new favourite restaurant
this place is awesome definitely authentic
a must stop when you are in montreal
this place reminds of st lawrence market in toronto but more veggies and fruits then seafood
omg  definitely worth going if you are in montreal
hidden on the east end of the danforth is a lovely thai restaurant
found this restaurant while surfing on yelp
decided to try this place after reading the reviews
was not disappointed
huge portions and a bit of a long wait
they will take phone orders over the walk ins
so call ahead to order
hidden in the east end of the danforth who knew there would be a little ethiopian community
its 35 stars but since i cant give half stars i will give it four
great place in chinatown to get banh mi just make sure you know what you want as it is really crazy in there and hectic the ladies behind the counter will harass you until you move along
very busy place here on a friday night
definitely has a queen street feel with the decor
cute place on a side street  really only serving the locals around the woodbinedanforth area
the loud banging always draws crowds as you walk by and see that the chef is making fresh noodles
noodles are delicious and you definitely need to make sure you save room in your stomach for this when you come to pacific mall
found this bakery while wandering on queen street  it was hidden on a side street
my boyfriend took me here for my birthday
at first i wasnt impress that it was a 45 mins wait however my bf really wanted to try this piece so we decided to wait
omg  came here with some friends for brunch and wow
great japanese restaurant in the bloor and church area
been coming here since the first opened years ago
they have some pretty interesting things here
love this place
cute little hole in the wall place
two entrances one by a side street by an apartment building and the other side of the entrance in the mall
came here for dim sum  its one of those mark on a sheet to order
my sister loves this place probably comes by once a week once every two weeks
long line ups for sunday brunch  but so worth it
stumbled upon this one day  thought i would give it a try
fish is good really good
love how you could have so many different options for fish choices
chips is only ok
onion rings are not the same as the regular onions a little too crispy
this place is really good
the best restaurant in the area
the food there is really tasty  especially the ahi tuna club sandwich lobster ravioli and the tandoori chicken flat bread
decided to give this place a try since i was in the neighbourhood love that there was no line up at all
however coming here at 5pm on saturday afternoon and only original flavour was left
small little japanese restaurant in the don mills neighbourhood
lots of different rolls to pick from
nice addition to the distillery district stumbled upon this place when we were out checking the lights festival
nice place for you to hang out and get a coffee tea or hot chocolate
they have a few flavours for hot chocolate  best part you can get it in a dairy free option
cute place in danforth and coxwell area
this is a most stop for me and my girlfriend whenever im back in to
we always order
really 35 stars
hand made noodles
great service
open kitchen
need i to say more
good cheap sushi
saw that there was a new place in the neighborhood and decided to try it out
they did not disappoint
nice and light tasting cakes
tried an original and matcha green tea slices
we had these guys cater our wedding
we ended up having 6 different flavors of cake
all were delicious although the carrot cake was especially exceptional
the staff was friendly and prepared
visiting from sf
checked yelp and found this place
it is very small  a converted house
as you sit in it you can watch the kitchen
the food was excellent
we had an eggplantred pepper omelet and peach waffles
the waffles were light and fluffy with fresh whipped creme
this place is always solid and the customer service always very nice
its not the best japanesekorean food out there but its consistently good
what is lacks in finesse it makes up for in portion size
the portions are huge
its our goto sushi place these days
sometimes it feels so good to be so badfor you
i have been dying to try out an actual poutinerie for a long time and it did not disappoint
ive been twice now
once i had the basic poutine and once i had the pulled pork poutine
both are good but i really love that pulled pork poutine
the bbq sauce they have has just a touch of sweetness and it really compliments the fries and cheese curds
a large poutine is more than enough for two people and i liked the little restaurant space with the 80s glam rock playing and quirky pictures on the walls
i guess my only criticism is that they need more seating
both times ive been we got lucky and managed to snag seats as someone was leaving but its gross out on the street and this summer anyway its been so hot outside
they dont have space for more seats so this isnt really something they can easily fix but maybe something to keep in mind for future establishments anyway if you want a very unhealthy treat its a go
we booked a reservation at smith for summerlicious
one of the major problems was finding it though
almost every one in our party either didnt see it initially its sort of nondescript looking or werent sure which doorstaircase was the proper one to get inside
poor hero burger is getting a lot of flack from people
ive never had anything but good experiences here
i think the burgers here are heads and tails above many other gourmet burger places mainly because the diversity of toppings
i went here with my husband and another couple as the start to our double date night
i reserved a table on the wednesday before and im glad i did but even still we were originally seats in a less than ideal table
i spoke to the hostess and a manager came out and graciously moved us which was very nice of them because apparently many people call and reserve specific seats
we went here after dinner simply for drinks
i wanted a cocktail and my sister recommended this place
i was so surprised to see the negative reviews of this place after having just had such a good experience there
we got recommendations for this place from my parents and so for our anniversary we booked here
we were told though that it was first come first served in terms of having the ideal seats by the windows that overlook the fountains of the bellagio and the strip
i went here for the first time yesterday night to celebrate something with my family
several members of my family have been to this place before for summerlicious and really enjoyed it
i had a craving for mexican and came here ie
yelp to figure out what we could do because there is a very real lack of good mexican food in toronto
this place had some good reviews and wasnt too far away from us so off we went
came here with my mother husband and baby for brunchlunch
we were all quite happy with our choice
i think i was the winner by ordering the french toast
it was practically half a loaf of bread
i am surprised at the people complaining about the service because we found the service to be fine
especially given how busy and cramped it was
there were no tables but they got us seats at the bar
the music was maybe a little loud but i enjoyed the 90s throwback that was happening
the place looks like a dive its a total hole in the wall with no signs to speak of but i liked the weird atmosphere of weird old ghetto blasters on the walls and pics of arnold in terminator
its random
our friends got the groupon for four people and took us along
im very pleased we went having never had ethiopian food before we were curious but wary
the deal really helped us dive in
it included two appetizers four main courses and two desserts
we started with two appetizers one i wasnt a huge fan of a salad with a strong vinegar taste and jalapenos
a little on the pricey end for baked goods but the baked goods are good
also their coffee products are great
the set up is annoying order your desserts on one side and coffee and food on another side but the service is good and overall they do a good job
went here with my sister and her boyfriend for some drinks
we were hungry and ordered a few appetizers to share
drinks were fine my mix drink was on the very small side but the food was really good
the perogies and chips and dip were excellent
the service was good and the atmosphere was nice
went here after dinner across the street at lemon bistro
was excited to see a nutella latte on the menu which i ordered and which was good but lacking much in the way of being really nutellaish
nothing says montreal like montreal brickoven cooked pizzas right
for some reason when i heard the name of this place i was initially turned off
i cant explain exactly why i felt this but perhaps it added to my pleasure when i found i really liked it
this place is a bit of an adventureat least for me
ive never had charcuterie before and im not generally a big meat eater so this was a little out of the box
that said i like trying to be adventurous and trying new things so when are visiting friends suggested we give it a go we went for it
dinner service is open at 6pm so we agreed wed arrive at 6pm
we got there at about 615there was already a huge wait for a table but we managed to wrangle seats at the bar
i have been craving schnitzel for a long time so on the night of my birthday my husband and i decided to come here
cafe polonez was in a great little area with lots of nice little shops surrounding it and high park of course
great little place one of my favs in the area which happens to have a number of fish and chip places actually
why well for starters the gentleman who owns the establishment is lovely and personable
i think their portions are large and the fish to be yummy and not too bland or overly breaded
i also really like that they make their own tartar sauce
so few places seem to do this
you get like 12 of those little packets
went with my friend who told me she really likes this place and gets their takeout every friday
seemed like a safe betand it was
been here twice now
always go with my parents when they come to visit
nothing particularly special about this place and i find some prices fine while others on the expensive side their salads are very expensive and they dont include a protein which is a considerable amount more for example and i find their tables are very low weird but annoying when trying to eat some thingslike my soup but the food has been consistently good as has the service and the atmosphere nice
wish they had more in terms of a kids menu but well be back
okay i have only ever ordered food from sushi one never been to the actual restaurant
ive had pretty mixed service in terms of delivery time but they usually tell you when you order the approximate time of delivery
went here on a bit of a whimjust looked up italian places in the areathere seems to be a lack of consistent italian food
this place is very authentic
part grocery and part restaurant they have a good selection on meats and cheeses and italian packaged treats
unfortunately when we arrived around 6 on friday they didnt have much food left
they informed us this was because it was almost close although close wasnt till 7pmso i guess this is more of a lunch place
that said they had one veal left and one penne pasta left
we bought them both
my toddler who hates pasta usually loved this pasta and i agree with him
it was delicious
my husband liked the sandwich and i also took a bite and it was yummy
went in on a whim and was not disappointed
i had the odb and my husband had the poutine
poutine was goodhad pulled chicken on it and was tasty although not entirely unique tasting but thats fine for this type of place
i had the odb and it was amazeballs the chicken was a huge portion on a full waffle
the waffle was the perfect blend of sweetness with just a bit of syrup and the chicken was crispy and great and so tender it just flaked apart
it had a great sauce on top and the slight kick blended with the sweetness of the waffle was a great mix
portion size was good food was delicious
came with a little cup of potato saladliked the peas nice touch and the potato salad was a refreshing touch for the whole dish
still thinking about it hours laterthinking and thinkingsigh
okay let me start by saying that yes i have had montreal bagels and nyc bagels and they are of course in a category all of their own
but lets focus on toronto bagels
well from what i can see from other peoples reviews this place has been getting a bad rap because of service
since i have been several times and never had a bad experience i can only give my review of this place based on what i have experienced
this place does burgers
it does them lots and it does them well
and it does them in about a million combos
try something different
just go for it
you will be pleasantly surprised
if youre notplease dont blame me
why is this place not closer to me actually its better that its not
i would get truly obese if it were because my new diet would consist of fried dough sauce and cheese
an awesome place to eat
they are always very friendly and accommodating if your hungry for desert you can have fresh ice cream from their attached ice cream shop
my family loves this place
im new to the area and stopped in here a few days ago to pick up a coffee maker
i love the abc stores
im a long time resident of vegas and have worked on the strip for years
abc is a great place to buy an inexpensive snack or drink
we stopped in here for lunch this afternoon
staff was helpful and friendly
food was good and you get a lot for the price
we noted that they deliver and since we live close by well probably order from them in the future
i was looking for a nice place to take the family to dinner last night
after reading the reviews and looking at the photos i settled on this place
great choice
we stopped by here for lunch this afternoon
the place was packed
recently had dinner here with my family and really enjoyed the experience
when im looking for a nice quiet drink in a clean bar this is always the place i choose
i often stop here for my coffee on the way into work and to get gas
service is usually fast and friendly
they have a fairly regular staff here who all know what theyre doing
an old fashion candy store
whats not to like
ive been here a few times over the years
id probably eat here more if i didnt live on the opposite side of town
weve been wanting to try this restaurant for sometime now and i thought valentines day would be the perfect day to give it a try
ive visited this place on and off since the 70s
this casino is a throwback to the old casino days when the hotels were smaller and smoke filled
stopped in here to pick up lunch on the way home today
ive visited this place a half a dozen times over the years
usually its a quick stop for something to eat late at night after i get off work
ive eaten here a couple of times
great food
friendly staff
excellent ambiance
very busy here this morning
we opted to go inside because the drivethrough was very long
i normally dont like coffee shops on the strip but i do like this one
have grabbed a quick bite to eat hear many times as its right around the corner from me
this is one of the best bars in town
not many of the yuppie types here
thank god
friendly staff
clean place
ate here with my girlfriend this evening
she had the mongolian entree and i had the pad cha cha cha entree
both were excellent
this location just opened
may 24th 2013 was there first day of business
ive eaten here a half a dozen times and have always had a good experience
this has been my quick stop store for a number of years as its right across the street from where i live
stopped in this evening for dinner
ive been here a half a dozen times over the years
every visit was a pleasure
stopped in here with my family for dinner today
ive been here half a dozen times since the new management took over in 2012
ive eaten here many times over the years and every experience was excellent
ive been here a half a dozen times
always a great dining experience
you dont get better than this for a mid range dining experience
i love bars that are a bit out of the way
the kind of places you really have to hunt down to find
so i got home last night and was craving something to eat
i didnt have much in the house because i hadnt been to the store in awhile
stopped in here recently to grab a bite on the way home
this one is right across the street from me
this is one huge casino
ive been in here many times over the years
i live way out on the west side of vegas and have on several occasions driven all the way to boulder city for one of these burgers
ive visited this place on and off since the late 80s
we ate here a month or so ago and i cant wait to visit again
it was my first visit and i really enjoyed it
ive lived in vegas nearly 40 years and am not a big fan of buffet food
but this is one buffet id enjoy eating at again
stopped in here for breakfast today while on a shopping trip to boulder city
i use this cvs all the time as its right around the corner from my house
actually im usually stopping to use the redbox outside but always peek my head in side just in case i see something i need
i use this gas station all the time as it is the closest one to where i live
i have only three words for this place
recently had dinner here with my family and really enjoyed the experience
we dont go out to eat a lot but when we do we like places that are a little different
this evening after a quick search on the net we discovered this place and thought wed give it a try
i work in the area so visit this location frequently
i usually stop here for coffee and a bagel
ive never tried their ice cream
stopped in for breakfast this morning
arrived right when they were opening and we were told we could sit anywhere we liked
weve eaten here in the past but ate here again on valentines day
the wait was an hour and a half but guess we should have expected this on valentines
what a fun and unique shop
a great taste experience
stopped by here today for the first time
if im in the neighborhood again and need a wash id stop by here again
flavor was actually pretty good
not used to eating menudo with tortilla but it was pleasant
lemonade had a very good flavor
did not have to ask for a refill it was brought to me
service was prompt and my food was at my table in no time
it was not really busy either so maybe that helped
good experience
this is place very great flavor
server was on top of things and everything that we ask for it was brought to us
chips and salsa given at the beginning of the meal had a great flavor as well
the bread with the menudo was toasted and a spread of butter which gave it a home flavor
i would gladly recommend this place
i was going to give 4 stars instead of  5 stars because the coke zero had expired but was gladly replaced with a new one
no questions asked
great service
great pizza and wings for the prize
great flavor wings were very good
timely in the order
this gem is tucked away in an alley at green valleys district area but dont let that fool you  going here you almost feel like youre no longer in las vegas nevada but rather in a different part of the world
it has a romantic intimate feel
the food is delicious and the drinks are fantastic
i came here yesterday to meet someone and a friend of mine  dominique  was bartending
others have commented on her ability to make incredible drinks and i will add on to those positive comments  whether you ask for something on the menu or something not on the menu it will be one of the best drinks you get in all of vegas
ive lived here a little while and i can testify  they are thinking of adding live music soon out on the little patio out front with the right artists this can only add to the experience
definitely recommended
my valentines day date took me here for dinner
first of all we were late for our reservation because my date had a corporate gig run late and they were extremely accommodating and friendly about it  when we arrived i got my fresh beautiful red rose all ladies who come here receive one and were seated immediately
we had a few different servers attend to us  one for wines one for our salad and another for the rest of our needs
i was blown away by the romantic setting incredible service and the impressive food  as a vegetarian your options are limited here but never fear  i had the vegetarian entree which changes by the day
when we went it was mushroom ravioli and oh wow
it was so good
they were out of the raspberry cheesecake when we got to dessert so we chose the berry tarte instead
im glad they were out of the cheesecake because we wouldnt have gotten to try it otherwise
there are no words for how good it was  everything about this experience was extremely positive
it is on the tad pricey side but if you want to really give a woman a romantic evening this is the perfect place to go unless youre vegan or a raw foodie that is
thank you hugos cellar for a lovely evening
i dont do ice creamish desserts pretty much ever but every once in a while i appreciate good custard  froyo
a friend took me here and both of us very much enjoyed what we had
hed been there before i hadnt  good custard is good custard but the walls covered in antique signs license plates and other 50sthemed memorabilia is a fun touch that makes it feel oldfashioned and fun
whether youre an occasional dessert lover like me or a passionate one youre bound to enjoy a visit here
i ate here with a friend and i plan to come back again because there are so many items on the menu that i want to try
i had the tomato basil pasta and it was so yummy
the portion size was good too i thought for the price  not too much and not too little
i like the outdoor seating option too though we did not take advantage of it
the district is a beautiful place to be so if youre in the area stop by
the food and the scenery are both very worthwhile
ive been here twice and have had great food and aplus service both times
i love that theyre open 247 too  its hard to find good nonfastfood restaurants with those hours so this place is a goto in that department as well
i cant remember what i had the first time i came here but most recently i had their ravioli  yum  thanks bootlegger
the only downside to this place i think is that it needs more seating
ive heard that this one has more than the other vegas location but my friend and i had to wait a few minutes to get a place to sit for two
other than that
the service was great
im a vegetarian and they let me swap out the meat that was on the menu for a side dish so i was able to make my meal even more healthy
its a fun place because they have two sides to the menu healthy and happy ie
i think this one ends up getting between a 3 and a 4 star if only i could do halfstars here from me and heres why
from the outside this doesnt seem like the kind of place that would have a veggie burger or have amazing service but they have both  their red wine is also delicious
i wish i would have grabbed the servers name she was awesome and completely on top of things making sure my friend and i were taken care of while we were there
looking forward to coming back at some point
id been to the hash house downtown but not this particular location in the linq
this time around i had breakfast  specifically the pancake yes it was one singular pancake
see picture below
the waiter we had was attentive and checked on us often
also the freshsqueezed juice was very delicious
a girlfriend and i found our way here and it happened to be happy hour
we couldnt believe the prices especially for tivoli village  the wine was so good and the food was delicious as well
i think the guy who made our food was also our server which i appreciated since i really enjoyed what i ate and got to tell the chef in person how much i enjoyed it
he is not only a great cook but an attentive and engaging server
i cant wait to come back here again
i went here last week with a friend and it was fantastic
first of all i love that they make the guacamole right in front of you
very cool  and also it was very delicious  i got the vegetarian fajitas yum and i had enough food for two more meals later  so definitely  value for your money
the service was also fantastic
i didnt even have to run out of water before the waiter was at my table giving me more
i think we had maybe three different waiters attending to different things at our table
all in all my friend and i felt very well taken care of
i recently moved here from the midwest
never going to eat mexican back home again
im too spoiled now  great experience and delicious food
love the vibe of this place  my date and i got to eat on the second level so we got the bonus of a great view
there isnt much on the menu thats vegetarian otherwise itd be a fivestar rating for me but the portabello mushroom sandwich and salad i had was delicious  i cant remember what our appetizer was called but they were yummy as well picture below
i even sprang for the carrot cake my date had cheesecake for dessert  no regrets  our server was attentive and courteous and his recommendation the appetizer was spot on
great eats
ive been here twice now and there are definitely dishes here that are better than others
im vegetarian so im limited to begin with and im kind of a health nut so that limits me further
if youre at all like me avoid the egg dishes with the hash browns in my opinion there wasnt enough taste to compensate for how much oilbutterfat was clearly used
on the other hand the waffles with fruit are so good
i havent tried the pancakes but plan to next time im there
i havent tried any of the dinner options not many options there for vegetarians but if you like having breakfast anytime this place is open 247 and serves breakfast items all day and all night
its a handy place to come if its midnight and youre starving
delicious gourmet food to be had here  i had two different dishes  both vegetarian  and i enjoyed them both immensely
dont come here if you plan on cramming yourself with as much food as you can eat rather come here to enjoy the experience of eating
the portion sizes are on the smaller size but all of the tastes are worth savoring
i played music for a private event here and wow  the view is amazing day or night
its a small venue but swanky
the secret elevator to get to it made it feel like i was in on something really neat
the food was also spot on
im not sure if it was catered or if the ghostbar staff made it on site
this was the first restaurant i went to upon moving here to vegas
great first impressions  im a vegetarian so i had the tofu burrito
i cant remember everything i had on it but there are so many options
the place was crammed when we were there  and no wonder
i love the fusion of sushi and mexican
you wouldnt think these two things could go together but they do and its yummy
definitely plan on returning here
never before have i experienced such a customizable pizza place and i love it  i especially appreciate the vegan cheese options as well as the awesome selection of toppings
so much fun and so much deliciousness
cant wait to come back again
wow  i loved this place  i had no idea what to get since id never been there before but it seems like its a win no matter what you might choose
i cant wait to come back here many times to try different combinations
the staff here are all super nice people and our waitress checked on us lots of times to make sure we were taken care of and enjoying our meal
so so good
if you havent tried this place and youre looking for something different go for it
wow i love this place  ive been to one of the other sambalatte locations in town but i like this one better
the upstairs with recliners and little tea tables just adds to the cozy appeal
their teas ive now tried three different kinds are all great and my friend  who had the hot chocolate  said that was delicious as well
their christmas decorations that were up when i went were also adorable and pretty
look forward to coming back here and maybe exploring boca park a little more as well
came here with a friend and had the spinach and peaches salad and one of the burgers which i subbed in a veggie burger for i believe
great food  the server was also very attentive  checked on us often and refilled my water even when i didnt need it
a convenient locale if youre nearby
will likely come back again
really liked this place  i came here for the rock star beer fest only a bummer because they ran out of beer and wine so quickly and really liked the vibe of the place
definitely plan on coming back here  and ill swim then
okay so  five star rating not easy to get from me
but this place has to be on my top ten favorite restaurants in vegas as of this moment
their hummus is out of this world
i actually liked it more than the wrap that i had which was definitely tasty
seriously
you have to go and try it for yourself
its a hidden gem
you can easily miss it even looking for it as my date and i did
the service is also good
the people who work there are really nice so thats of course part of the five star rating
its mediterranean so it might go without saying that there are vegetarian options aplenty but i wont let it go unsaid
please just do yourself a favor
go here and try it out yourself
if youre a hummus lover as i am your life is not complete without trying the hummus here
you can thank me later
if youre in the venetian this place is definitely a lovely place to stop
while my friend and i were there a couple months ago there was a trio of live musicians playing beautiful italian music  a flutist a violinist and an accordion player and we had a good view of them while enjoying our food
our server was very attentive and our food was delicious
they had some interesting vegetarian options which is an absolute must for me
if i can make it at home why go to a restaurant and pay for it  i had their ravioli with a special sauce nuts and asparagus  very good
i cant remember what my friend had but he enjoyed his meal as well
for dessert we decided on the tiramisu and it was a good choice
i definitely recommend this place especially if youre wanting to go on the gondola rides since this restaurant is just around the corner
i dont usually take the time to review every subway i drop into but i received such great service at this one that it stood out too much not to
i cant remember the girls name who made my sandwich but it was a well made sandwich
she was honest about which vegetables were the most fresh too which is not something you usually find in a chain fast food restaurant
anyway i was super hungry and was so glad this place was open late
will stop here again if im near here and have that subway craving
if youre in the downtown vegas area and are looking for some quick and delicious thai food this is the place
both my date and i enjoyed really good drinks as well  the bartender there is excellent  im a vegetarian and there are plenty of options here no matter your diet vegan options are also available
when i ordered the tofu pad thai the server checked in with me about the fish sauce that its made with since i dont eat fish i was very grateful he asked  not all restaurants are so up front
delicious eats
i definitely plan to return here
i came here to hear a friend sing but i did order their flatbread pizza
im a vegetarian and when i asked for it without meat they were perfectly accommodating it sounded like my request wasnt a common one  and it was very yummy
but their mojitos  off the charts
very nice vibe to this place i plan on coming back
i cant remember the name of what i had but there are vegetarian options here and they are yummy
i didnt plan on having dessert but the bartender suggested something that id never had before so i sprung for it
it was very cinnamony and i enjoyed it
the bartender was super nice too
definitely recommend this place
the way the light casts into this cafe
it really makes you feel like youre on the other side of the world from the las vegas strip  my date and i came here for lunch er our breakfast  were night owls and both of us had the madeinhouse yogurt with the fresh berries  just amazing
delicious
im salivating at 330 in the morning just thinking about it
i cant remember the main course that my date ordered but he enjoyed it immensely
i got an omelette i like that it was not heavily salted or greased as i feel most restaurant omelettes are
i added the amount of salt i wanted and it was perfect
the whole wheat toast that came with was delicious as well  to top off the positive experienced our server was very sweet and checked on us frequently
definitely a fan of this place and definitely coming back at some point
fremont street is one of those places that has a lot to offer in terms of entertainment
often youll have live bands playing on the stage awesome street performers and even chippendale guys that pull you in for a sexy photo shoot
honestly with all the veryscantilyclad girls you might want to avoid this place if you have kids between that and all the rampant cigarette smoking and drunk people probably not a good idea to bring family here
also a bad part of town is not far away so best if you have company with you if youre a single lady
i havent tried the ziplining but would like to at some point
the overhead lcd screen sometimes has good shows sometimes meh
but its a quintessential part of las vegas history
there are great restaurants cool bars and lots of unique vendors to experience and theyre different every single day
so never the same experience twice
gotta try it out
went here over christmas to see the beautiful cactus garden all decked out in lights  it did not disappoint  a truly fun and beautiful display  this is definitely on my mustvisit list every christmas as long as i live here  and best of all its free to visit and meander through
i havent had any of the food here yet but the wine and drinks are amazing  the bartenders are all great  friendly and attentive and of course they make very yummy mixed drinks
look forward to coming back here and sampling some of the cuisine
so happy i found this place  theres a good reason for the five stars
well actually plenty of good reasons
my friends and i had great service they had a veggie burger and their salads had easily the best croutons i have ever had in vegas
not your cheap breakyourteeth croutons i dread with most salads crispy on the outside and soft on the inside
i am fangirling just remembering
the veggie burger was also delicious
then again its hard to go wrong with veggie burgers since ive never met one i didnt like  plus theyre open 247 and the prices are good for strip or near the strip
im sure ill be back here again
cant believe i forgot to review this when i went in november
amazing mojito thanks to the very awesome bartender there  i cant remember his name but both of the bartenders there were super friendly
i had a big veggie burrito and it was very very delicious
next time im at the hard rock ill definitely plan on coming here to eat
good food and though there arent a lot there are solid vegan  vegetarian options if youre looking for those
the mixed drinks here are also delicious
cool vibe and neat setup
its worth a stop if youre a local and youve never been
if it werent so incredibly smoky in here id give this place 5 stars
the drinks are delicious the bartenders are cool and the singerspiano players are always on point  i might be biased since im friends with two of them but i enjoy the people who get up and sing with them too
maybe one of these days ill be brave enough to put myself out there and sing but for now ive enjoyed myself just being a spectator
very intimate small jazz club feel
cant wait to come back
i met a group of friends there and proceeded to hang out and dance for a few hours
the music got to deafening level a few times which wasnt great but otherwise we loved this place
the drinks were good the glow sticks made the night even more fun and the bookshelves and small vases with red roses made it feel classy and sophisticated
really enjoyed my night here
i havent had any of the food here yet but the mojitos are amazing  i came here to see a friend play in a jazz trio which i really enjoyed as well
will have to try the food sometime when im here next
ive been to their henderson location for which i kind of like the layout better but the pizza is just as good here
a friend and i came here for a later dinner and all the workers were friendly and the pizza was delicious
thanks again metro pizza
first of all let me just say this do not discount this store in star ratings because they dont have an electronics section or more nonfood items
it is a neighborhood market
do you know what market means  it means food
drive two more blocks to the supercenter and stop wasting peoples time by saying how crappy this location is because it isnt a supercenter
first world crybabies
came here with a friend a couple weeks ago and enjoyed the whole experience
the weather was still warm enough that we could sit outside comfortably and the lights on the patio as the sun went down made for a wonderful eating atmosphere
the food was delicious  most especially the tableside guac we ordered
i had a small amount left over that i took home with me and enjoyed later
i couldnt waste even a spoonful     i come to the galleria mall most often of all the vegas malls so ill think of chevys next time im there and am in the mood for mexican
i was craving thai food and was in the neighborhood though it was almost closing time i got takeout and it was ready in almost no time at all
to be honest ive had tofu pad thai at many different restaurants and the way they make it here doesnt have the most flavor i say that as a compliment however because it tastes like it could be made at home with regular ingredients  not tons of msg like i think a lot of thaiasian food places use to give people that flavor they just cant get at home
sometimes
dont let the look of this place fool you  it seems like itd be a hole in the wall kind of place but the food is great  the only thing keeping it from five stars was that other than to place and receive our orders we didnt get any table service and had to ask for the check
its definitely a casual atmosphere but the food is worth it
and best of all  its open 24 hours a day just in case youre craving some late night thai
i dont give out many fivestar ratings but i love this place  ive been vegetarian my whole life so ive always been a fan of restaurants with this hippiehappy vibe
i love that one of their walls is covered in real greenery as well
its about as much real greenery as youll see in one place in all of vegas haha
i came here to play music for a private event and i loved it
the view alone is gorgeous and worth whatever you have to pay to enjoy it well i got paid to enjoy it haha
it has a swanky vibe though its a smallish club
i look forward to coming back here and enjoying a drink or two
the service here was excellent  my boyfriend and i came here for dinner and we were seated almost immediately
the server checked on us a lot which i really appreciate  we had the chips and guacamole to start which was very yummy
i think i couldve made an entire meal of it haha
i got the tofu brown rice bowl which was absolutely and incredibly delicious
im a lifelong vegetarian and a tofu snob when i say its good its good
i cant wait to come back here again the entire experience was wonderful
came here late night with a friend and ordered the vegetarian fajitas  yum  great service as well
we had a couple different wait staff take care of us other than our main waitress too  all very attentive
i never got to the bottom of my water glass
i really liked the decor here too
great place cant wait to come back  ive been to their other location in henderson its a winwin
wow  just loved everything about this experience
the food was very delicious the waiters were constantly making sure we had enough water were satisfied with our food and were otherwise taken care of
the decoration of the place is cool too  definitely not what youd expect looking at it from the outside
and for all you vegetariansvegans theres plenty to eat here  and though i cant remember what dish i had the waiter picked it out for me it was so good
definitely a spot ill come back to
such a cool place  love to just hang here relax with friends get some food and grab a drink
the outside is so neat at night  cool outside lighting mini fire pits to sit around etc
cant wait to come back here
i really enjoyed this restaurant and all it had to offer
the decor and atmosphere is intimate and romantic  dim lighting cool africansafarithemed art on the walls etc
i had the gardenburger and sweet potato fries for my meal and it was completely delicious
i also ordered a mojito  and as i say ive never met a mojito i didnt like this one was particularly delicious  although theres a specific recipe on the menu theyll flavorinfuse your mojito with any number of fruit options i chose pomegranate and it was amazing
the waitress was very friendly provided recommendations for us and was very attentive to us the entire time we were there
i never got to the bottom of my glass of water in my mind a clear sign of great service
in addition the street surrounding this restaurant is beautiful and intimate especially at night lights strung from tree to tree brick street and classy shopping and eating venues
definitely a fantastic date option  cant wait to come back here again
just as good as the other location ive been to here in town  this one is actually closer to me so it wins awesomeness points just for that
the prices are a bit on the high side but the food is delicious and healthy so i say its worth it
its hard to find healthy fast food but this definitely qualifies
and its right off the 215
have been here a couple of times now and really like the vibe of this place
ive had good service each time i visited and enjoyed quite a few of the vegetarian options
their black bean burger is delicious  the beer selection here of course is awesome as well
this is one of my goto places in town for sure
staying at the hotel made it so we got in for free
that was a nice touch
make sure you get in early
go at opening if you can
the line gets pretty heavy after noon especially on weekends
i had walked by here several times without even realizing what it was
thankfully i finally took the time to check it out
it is in a convenient location on the first floor of cosmopolitan right in the middle of all the action
great view of the strip from the balcony
the environment is great
the crowd is interesting
on paper this is a grand concept especially to someone like myself that loves nachos so much
this one is in an odd location just off the strip but is worth finding if you want some nachos while watching some sports
there is a lot of indoor seating and some outdoor as well
they have a lot of televisions through out
this is by far my favorite place to settle in and watch a game
the catch is you have to be there early to get one of the comfortable seating areas
if you can get one of the couches then settle in and enjoy
the food was great
from the appetizers to the deserts it was very good
the service was solid and the scenery is very good
the atmosphere is very dry because of all the business people eating there
the food is good
it is best for a casual dinner or appetizers
it is a good place to enjoy drinks and people watch the casino
we were eating here so we could easily get into the club
it turns out the food is actually pretty good
they sat us just a few minutes late
we found a nice spot by the bar to have a few pre dinner drinks
the drinks are pricey but the setting is great
this was a nice surprise for us
we left las vegas early to get out to the grand canyon but did not want to deal with the crowds to eat there
yelp came through with this little gem on our way
it is small
there is a parking lot out behind it
this is the old time local diner some still remember
the food is affordable and you get a lot for your money
the environment is cool and classy
you can get away with casual attire but a little dressier would fit better
this is definitely an option for a romantic dinner as well
i was happy to see a javiers opening in las vegas
it is not the same without the ocean views but it is still good
the crowd is also very different not quite the newport set
this is an interesting place
most of it is a large eclectically decorated diner and there is also a decent sized lounge in the back
there is a large parking lot out front and even more space out back
this place gets crazy busy so plan ahead
there is a ton of seating and they turn tables fairly quickly but there is often still a wait
if you come during any peak meal hours be prepared to wait
we made reservations for brunch on christmas morning
this place is not something you will find by accident
it is hidden away near the tower suites
this is a very good burger joint
i am always concerned when trying out places that are over hyped
while i do not believe it is the best burger it is certainly worth the trip
this is one of the best looking bars i have ever seen in las vegas or elsewhere especially if you are on the middle level
it is almost a get away from the hectic pace of las vegas
this is a good location
it is probably even better in the summer when the outdoor area is open
our server was friendly and attentive
we returned to the capital grille this time with some friends
i could not help myself and ordered the dry aged steak au poivre with a courvosier cream sauce again
it did not disappoint
the steak was seasoned and cooked perfectly
the cream sauce adds a nice flavor
of course we had to have a side of the au gratin potatoes
i had talked them up and after dinner everyone admitted we should have ordered at least one more order of them
the service was excellent
our server was attentive and genuinely friendly
the bus boy did not let our water get below half full
the food is tasty
the bread they bring out is good
the chili oil dip for it is great
it has a nice flavor and a little kick
we have stayed at cosmo so many times
we have ate at the restaurants inside so many times but had yet to visit rose
it is buried deep inside cosmo just past the buffet
the decor is cool and quite unique
there is a big bar inside too if you have some time to kill before your reservation
i really wish jimmy johns would open some locations in los angeles
it is a great lunch option
the sandwiches are flavorful and filling
the bread is quality and the toppings are fresh
the staff at this location was friendly and quick
there were two very large trade shows in town and it was the week leading up to the super bowl so finding a table was going to be tough
boa was able to sit us within 30 minutes
we sat at the bar for a few minutes while we waited for our table
they have an excellent selection of quality licquors
i was happy to see a good assortment of whiskeys
this is a good place to stop and relax for a minute to do some people watching
they have a good drink menu with solid scotch choices
you are not going to find much better views of the las vegas strip
we sat at a table on the bar side of mix
that is where the best views are
just by having queso fundido with chorizo on the menu tt was off to a great start
it was pretty solid queso too
if you self park mgm gets off to a bad start
the entrance from the parking garage is pathetic
once you get into the actual building you wander through a hallway of shops that reminds you of a bad mall that is about to close for good
first impressions mean a lot
clearly not a lot of thought was put into this
solid beers  christmas ale defines my holiday season
i moved away a long time ago but whenever i am home i try to make a stop at great lakes
great vibe super chill stellar food and beer
love love love a taste of the caribbean the braised oxtails are heavenly succulent and fall off the bone tender
they had me audibly moaning with delight the entire meal
the plantains and braised cabbage on the side were perfect sides and the rice with pigeon peas was perfect for sopping up all that oxtail sauce
pizza is mega rad
im a sucker for chewy bubbly crust like theirs
and you cant beat the lunch specials at less than five bucks for pizza and a drink salad bar is a little sketch sometimes at this location
ive seen too many young ones duck the sneeze guard and get crazy with the toppings
cafe monarch is everything the five star reviews make it out to be and more
its a must try for a unique brunchlunchdinnerwhatever experience in the valley im reluctant to review this place since i dont want to wade through patrons on my way to another lovely sunday brunch but my taste buds will not be deterred
plus i have until september before they reopen so theres plenty of buffer room
i awake wild eyed in a cold sweat visions of caramel creme macaroons soliciting me like high class tricks in a whorehouse croque monsieurs their swanky pimps demanding payment for service
essence strikes again
the only way to vanquish these dreams is to lunch here on a regular basis
this was a great end to a dreary rainy gloomy draining no good very bad day
barros is what digiorno wishes it could be with that rising crust crap
i swear if i could eat barros every day without my arteries protesting i would
and could because its cheaper compared to other pricier options like venezias and spinatos
only ever eaten in the bar during happy hour so this review is not for old school steak house fare with all the fixins
this place really doesnt need another review but seeing how its my home away from home i feel obliged to speak up from the peanut gallery
the beast embrace it
if you havent been here
stop reading this review ignore the fact that you just ate an hour ago and go nosh the shit out of some of the best damn chicken youll find in the valley
cheeburger cheeburger
why did you leave me i feel adrift in a world without good szechuan
everywhere i go puts a stupid amount of cornstarch in their sauces
come back please
i am a hummus fiend
i have made tabbouleh so delicious that the heavens parted and rained down tears of joy upon its consumption
i will cut a bitch over the last dollop of garlic dip
dont even get me started on baba ghanoush
confession time i dont really like barbeque
its sweet and vinegary and weird and ruins perfectly good smoked meat
but the last two times ive been out for this kind of food i have been pleasantly surprised
maybe as i age my appreciation for tangy tomato sugar paste matures
im a classy broad like that
or maybe i just need to frequent places that know how to serve up barbeque right and thats exactly what urban campfire does
when i hit a quarter of a century in years i decided to go the uncharacteristically classy route and celebrate with something chi chi and razzdango
exchange the morning after whiskey dents and zombie flavored scratch n sniff composure for a posh dinner out on the town
ive been going to the roosevelt since just after it opened and im extremely pleased to see how its blossomed into such a lovely little bar with excellent patronage
my little boys all growed up
im clearly more of a food city consumer than an ajs gal but this place succeeds in making me feel like i not only can but should splurge on a five dollar loaf of bread to go with the homemade soup i just whipped up for pennies
i can deal with the prices because this place is perfect for the occasional uberspecialty ingredients that i cant get anywhere else
edible flowers for crystallizing espresso powder for my meat rubs fancy pants mushrooms high quality chocolate duck fat mangosteens outside of an asian grocer the works
does anyone remember when mill avenue used to be a fun place to hang out yeah neither do i but ive been told from the horses mouth sorry to call you a horse mr
man that it used to be a hip and happening place with plenty of small custom shops and dives instead of the now ubiquitous megacorporate whorebaggery
luckily you have only to travel a little bit further west on university to steep yourself in that old school neighborhood feel
holy effin eff best happy hour anywhere in the valley
you like your meat long smoked and spicy they got that
thai iced tea with condensed milk and boba
perfection
i love the flaky soft texture of the snoh ice
i want to make sticky snow angels in a vat of it
get red bean or taro
avoid the boring strawberry
ode to tops liquor
every time i go waltzing around the district ahem twice i make sure to stop by this hidden gem for some extreme iced tea action
i use extreme in the sense that theres 100s of options that all end in awesome
white peach iced awesome iced pomegranawesome four awesome berry tea creme brulawesome
and those are just the flavors ive sampled
i could be the richmeister from snl while lavishing praises upon these teas
best place for pho i have found in the valley
get the 1 with everything tripe tendon fatty flank meatballs and the regular beef
dont let the ingredients intimidate you
its out of this world good
there are several shared characteristics of a good dive bar
one delirious food coma a heavy dollop of cholesterol two thick slices of saturated fat and a mild case of diabetic shock to go please
me and cerretas have got some history
probably because i grew up in glendale which is filled with boring suburbs of cookie cutter homes surrounded by six foot concrete security gates that house dysfunctional 25 kiddo families and promote a sense of community as deep as a valley girls vocabulary
it goes by many names
boba tea bubble tea
well maybe just two names
its really the texture thats more up for debate
melty gelatinous gummy balls that are sproingy on the teeth is one way to describe it
black phlegmatic chunks of mucous laden smokers lung is another
its all about perspective
i really want to give this place four stars
greg would string me up by my toenails and make me repent for my burger sins if he knew i was reviewing his favorite place as just a three star burger joint
but i cant abide paying ten to twelve bucks for a fast food burger fries and a drink
thats crazy cakes
apparently haji baba isnt open on sundays so we decided to hit up tasty kabob instead of calling it off and heading home
the little parking lot in a strip mall off apache was bustling with activity so i hoped we would be able to score a table easier than we had tried for a parking spot
i dont like waiting for the first meal of the day
i turn into the reckapotamus from hell whose disposition is a combination between that of a pissed off hippopotamus and an icy cold imp from the underworld
im of the opinion that breakfast is pretty hard to fuck up
if youre not ordering something hoity toity the following formula applies hot grilleggsmeatcarb breakfast
my stomach and i are proud to say inform you that jp
pancakes has mastered that formula
they even include some variables in the equation that will knock off your socks and spin them around your head
i have since been back twice once for breakfast and another time for lunch
stan thank you for sacking whoever was dicking off the thing last time i came in to visit
let me help you out here gollo burro green style
chicken enchilada lunch special green style
dont worry about anything else on the menu
trust aunty erica to lead you along the path of good taste
these are the fivestar absolutely stellar staples of this establishment
i know im going to loose me some cool points for this one but i feel no shame at all in shouting i love monkey pants
the quality of the food is great they are specialized in goat cheese
it is a convenient place for a romantic supper or a diner at lunch break i would totally recommend this place if you are a cheese addict this is the place to be
watch out on weeknights for opening hours thursday and friday it is opened later
good food good people an amazing place if youre interested in genuine mexican people and real people
cool place staff is friendly
the food is fresh the sushi was great it is fusion sushi though interesting flavours
regarding the price we payed 70 each for 5 pieces of sashimi and 13 pieces of sushi
great place to eat crust has an italian style the ingredients are fresh you can choose your ingredients
its a great place for a date or just a casual super with some friends totally recommend this place
and price is great too
small family restaurant fish was really fresh all the cooks were japanese thats something to account for i would definitely recommend this place there is a little grocery shop on the side with a wide variety of imported japanese products
service was quick
i went to italy a couple of times and this pizza is really resemblant
the ambiance is classy perfect for a date or a family diner
prices are great good quality food and good service
i will come back for sure
the wings are very good for a great price
i love the honey hot better then most wing spots
i came here the other day and for the life of me i cant remember the name of what i ordered
i highly recomend this place if you are a health nut like my self
i felt so healthy and had so much energy when i left this place  i cant wait to come back and want to try everything on the menue
im pretty impressed food was fab
so many flavors if your in the mood for something different try this place
love thier chocolate covered fruits  all thier fruit is always fresh love this place
best chain italian food spot in charlotte so far
great customer service
love thier ribs creme brulea cheesecake  and the artichoke lobster dipsooo good
definitely enjoyed lunch here
outdoor patio has lots of shady seating
we had the jess pizza on gf crust
garlic oil with motzerella spinach bacon roasted garlic and ricotta
the crust was nice and crispy
the flavor was great and we enjoyed it
love this place make my usual run when im in the market
great variety of fresh  deli meat and cheeses from around the world
you want some quality this is the place to hit
but what binds it for me  its the great staff
friendly and knowledgeable
i cant say enough about this gem in the st lawrence market no problem in letting you taste the great products
and lets not forget  angie is smoking hot  but if your having friends over  and looking for amazing products to give your party that wow factor this is the place
delivery regina has been around a long  time
its been around since i was a kid when lived around that area
i live downtown king and church and was pleasantly surprised that they delivered all the way down here a few years ago
always nice people when you place an order
i always enjoyed the pizza  regina special and have ordered sandwiches and pastas from here as well never disappoints
always good food and the delivery is actually quick
they are still around for one simple reason
the food is good
wow my second time here and i live around the area
i got to tell ya there is some goooood shit coming out of here
chicken is tasty and juicy the potato wedges are probably the best i have ever had nicely seasoned
everything is cook to order nothing frozen
one of the owners who i had the pleasure of meeting is a real nice dude and the rest of the staff are just real cool cats and lets not forget the real nice lady that works there  i inquired about the sauces and she was a real sweet hart and brought me a little taste of each to try which i really appreciated
real inviting
i got the 10 piece and large potato wedges for the second time and i did not disappoint just simply delicious
if you like fried chicken you got to eat here stole that line
if your around the area have a taste for yourself
real consistent food coming out of here
this time i ordered ahead for pick up
friendly and courteous i ordered my usual double cheese burger with putin and as usual my other half has her chicken burger with a side of onion rings this is probably our 5th time at this location and again great burger good flavour cooked nicely the putin was good  and covered in nice tasting  gravy
the chicken was very good according to her and we both enjoyed the onion rings
nicely done my compliments to the staff
this is still a somewhat newer walmart
the staff here is much better than the store on craig and mlk
while the same grumpy horrible shift manager works here
the food is just so yummy i had to come back
and the manager is so bubbly and sweet as are 99 of the people that work here
fresh bread muffins and of course bagels
the food is great very fresh
large portions several side choices for the sandwhichs
fries big enough to share
breakfast come with a bagel
the german pancake is great its a very light tasting meal i recommend giving it a shot
you combine butter powder suger and lemon juice inside the pancake bowl
if your like me and are trying to make some changes to your eating habits
while avoiding  cooking meals for 6 plus
this is a great store to visit
they are 24hrs and in the same shopping center as  my gym
so what i have been doing is going there in the morning for whatever  items i need for my shakes that day or week protein they have  small meals prepared that are prefect for two
so we have been grabbing lunches and dinners there to
locally grown yummy food
the philly cheese steak sandwhich with a side of ranch is great
the tea is just right not to strong and not to weak
they are twenty four hours but wont server lunch stuff until after 6am
the prices are great too
other than smashing their burgers they do something else special
i mean they must to make the meat that tasty and full of flavors
its not common to find burgers you could eat just plain but i swear you could do that with theirs
my party had the philly cheese steak egg rolls having read some previous reviews i wasnt sure if they were going to be good
so i tried one with out the sause to see it the meat tasted froozemicrowaved it had nice flavor and the dipping sause was great
not the newest or nicest smiths around
but they have some of the best line management
there is always someone up there directing customers and calling people up to the registers
but it looks like its going to close in june 2015 because they dont plan on renewing there lease
the look of this olive garden is some much warmer than the older ones
plus it feels more upscale
this is my favorite place to stop in at after a long day
they took the time to learn my name and order
i am greeted when i come in and the wait is almost always shorter than expected
the haizleys hot link sandwich is wonderful
it has a lot of flavor and is a treat for your taste buds
but it is also very messy
you have to try to deep fried mushrooms
they are so good when dipped in ranch
the atmosphere in this place is friendly and fun
and the menus build to custom order
so if you have someone in your life that simply cannot order straight off the menu they would like this dinner
greek food that will male your mouth water
this place is a jewel beautifully decorated the servers are warm and friendly
they will explain the menu and some favorite choices if its your first time
i kept it somple and had a wrap
i wish i had talen a picture of it
but i just couldnt put it down
they have refilled everything i ha e been in three more times and each time the carrots and radishes are fresh and filled and they were cleaning
i recommend the king arthur supreme with the white sauce its so good
if your someone who doesnt care for red sauce
they also have a lunch special which is very popular
this is hands down the best  pizza chain for taste
price is higher but its matched by quality
if you go here sit in the bar roxanne and linda are amazing
these two ladys have kept us coming back for several years now
coffees good plenty of cream and sugar on the table so you wont have to ask for more
the best sub chain
the team at this location is learning quickly and already very busy
the food taste fresh and full of flavor
and the portion sizes are prefect to fill you up but not waste any
the girl at the counter was friendly and she got our order right
they have a great little buffet that changes every day
sat have fajitas and they are super yummy
this is my favorite mexican food chain
the grande taco salad its great
with a side of ranch of course
the food is very good the black and bleu is one of favorites
its  juciey tasty treat
the barely batter broccilli is yummy as well
my favorite place to get pizza and beer with friends in tempe
this place has a tendency to get busy and parking is terrible though so try to go during not peak times and definitely carpool or ride share
best thai food in tempe
the avocado green curry is incredible
i went in the middle of the day during the summer when everyone leaves town so i was the only one there and the staff was surprisingly unattentive given that fact but that might not be characteristic of the place
the absolute best place to sit and drink and talk with friends in tempe
theres no loud music and the atmosphere in general makes it a perfect hangout
the employees are also all great and nice
i wish i could transplant this place wherever i move
i really miss it now that ive left tempe
the first time i went here the burger tasted like it had been reheated from frozen
it took me two years to go back and three to try another burger
that said the burgers are okay
the sandwiches and pizzas especially when theres a special are great
the beer is great
the air conditioning is not but if youre from the area youre used to it
if youre visiting you might be miserable
my recommendation go with a friend and ordered a caeser salad and fish and chips and share
yum this place hit the spot last night
i had dinner plans with a friend and we were both craving something flavorful as usual and also wanted to go somewhere we havent been
scared of encountering yet another lackluster thai restaurant we decided to try cafe lalibela and convinced two other friends to go with us
i havent had ethiopian in awhile and it was like experiencing it all over again
copper star has always been a place that feels like home to me and the owners have spared no expense at making their next venture  circle h barbecue feel the same way
i also cant thank them enough for seeing the potential in the old taco cabana and for keeping their bathroom signs  its a riot
how have i never reviewed filmbar this is exactly the kind of place phoenix had needed for ages and the type of theater i craved
see i dont really like big box anything stores restaurants etc
and this even includes theaters
i also dont really care for most major motion pictures either
about 1 every year interests me enough to pay a bajillion dollars and sit with 10 million other people
some people may call this place in incomplete
the hand painted signage on the windows that some use on their cars the  patio tables for seating inside
the empty feel it has
i however think it was on purpose
some way somehow it causes instant relaxation
the brightly colored walls combined with the patio furniture really did calm me down and allow us to enjoy a two hour conversation without ever being pushed to leave
hell we didnt even get our bill until the wonderful matt c
asked if we could pay
ive been wanting to get to this place for ages but just never found the right time or occasion
it happened to be perfect earlier this week for dinner with a friend after i was picked up from the airport
this past weekend i had my staycation in phoenix for a little downtime
saturday a few friends and i wanted to go somewhere delicious no one had been and one of them suggested portlands
i had only been there for drinks a couple times and loved the bar area so i figured it would be nice to come back and try some dinner
i once again feel the need to sing my praises for lucis
and more specifically the weekday morning crew
at some point i bought myself the best supplies to make myself a morning coffee for the road
and sometime a few days ago i realized that was a damn waste of money
because i was only going to end up at lucis
lucis is where i can go to get a nice dose of sunshine both weather wise and people wise
lucis is where i can go and make up my morning song about hot coffee and rather than have the staff look at me funny they freestyle right along with me
lucis is where the name field on the order sticker doesnt say name but rather says neighbor
lucis is where i can get breakfast for breakfast lunch and dinner
and weekday morning lucis is nice and calm and quiet which allows me to start the day at my own pace
im a pretty big ice creamgelato fan
pretty big
i stumbled upon angel sweet for the first time with the thanks of my handy dandy gps recommending the closest place to offer me sweet cold delicious victory
angel sweet was what popped up
sit down and prepare yourself as i tell you something that will change your life
i held true to my word and tried lunch here shortly after trying breakfast
i walked out with a texan to go and was completely happy and satisfied the rest of the day
and i came back the next weekend and had the same thing again
its a bar
theres food appetizers
theres one of the best selections of craft brews both to have there and take home in the valley
hands down
you cannot live here without visiting papago
i had what i can only describe as a mouthgasm my last visit to lees so i decided it was about time to give this place some props
picture going to a birthday party and mashing together your carrot cake and your ice cream
then having someone pour jameson on it
it was one of the most epic displays of ice cream ive ever seen
and ive seen my share of ice cream
it didnt even take longer than 3 minutes into our meal before everyone was thanking me for recommending cafe carumba as our lunch venue on friday
how could i recommend anything else though it was close to the office i hadnt been there before and well they serve breakfast til 2pm every day
there was absolutely nothing disappointing about this experience
the ever changing menu at conflict kitchen is one the reason i wish i was closer to pgh
or at least visited more often
the concept absolutely fascinates me
a pop up that has a revolving menu but always from a country we are in conflict with
this place is like donut crack
i love fresh and easy and i love this store
the selection really isnt that bad for a smaller market
i can get pretty much everything i need unless im shopping for a random hard to find item or something that is non food related like a swiffer mop though the refill pads are there
i love how clean the place is and the packaging and presentation of their items is well done
you can find a lot of items that foodies crave in decent sized portions to either make for yourself or prepackaged items that are also pretty delicious
the prices are decent and the staff is amazingly friendly
i love my weekly trip to fresh and easy for some goodies to last me the week
especially the part where i buy myself a 4 exquisite bouquet of flowers to bring home for my dining room table
who said a man needs to do that though if they wanted to this is a great place to go
they offer celebration champagne
with the colored sugar crystals
kinda like rainbow brites star sprinkles
but for grownups
the girlie girl in me squealed like a little piglet in delight
so while im not really a fan of chains or anything i have to give famous daves props for making what was turning out to be a birthday outing disaster a pretty damn good success
im a fan of the los dos a lot
a lot
dear fez
gallo blanco doesnt serve a bad breakfast but im not sure id rush back
just not really my style
my rating was a 35 but im rounding up to 4 because of how awesome the staff was with out table of 20 on saturday morning
we were able to get separate checks and no ones orders or bills were screwed up at the end
everything was also pretty much delivered on time and as wanted
if im a fan of a pasta place you know its pretty much awesome
especially if id go there again
until recently i was the duchess of dlish and its about time i updated my review to reflect how amazing of a place it truly is
a diamond in the rough
so lets get real here for a minute folks
all of you that call yourselves my friends that never told me this was behind lucky strike are dead to me
dead to me
i had to discover this due to a friend hosting karaoke there one night
the 4 stars is in comparison to other chipotles ive been to especially in this area
every single thing down to the smallest detail was so wonderful at totties that i could give nothing less than 5 stars
i was in the area with a friend to see a band play and remembered someone mentioning they liked totties
after the show we hopped in to see what it was all about
the restaurant smelled intoxicating
if that wasnt enough the decor wooed me in the rest of the way
we were seated promptly and given menus to review
one of the most relaxing places thats within biking distance from my house
i am indeed one lucky gal
im not a pizza fan and i will always be up for an order from barros
thats how amazing it is
despite being a chain one of my favorite wine stores is wine styles
ive always loved how they categorize their wines and conduct their tastings
i wanted to post a review on the waitress we had for smunch yesterday nancy but it looks like i can only review a business so ill just update this one
z pizza is one of the best places i have discovered
mainly because i dont like tomatoes and z is not totally about tomatoes either
there are so many items on their menu i have not been disappointed with from pesto pizza to cheesy bread to salad
all of them tomato free
hi my name is tonia and i fully endorse a good artisan ice cream place in uptown so i dont have to force myself to trek to north scottsdale
i was craving thai like no other today go figure after passing tipps 88 in tempe while running errands
seeing that its closed on sundays thanks gabi i convinced a friend okay it didnt take any convincing at all to head to swaddee in our continuing search for best thai food in phoenix
carlsbad is truly one of my favorite places in the valley although i usually only get the opportunity to go for lunch
this place also holds a special place in my heart because it was my first real meal in arizona
this is where i went to lunch on my first trip out here for an interview
its also a favorite place for my coworkers and i to visit
any place that can convince me to try tomatoes in any form wins a prize
and so far the roosevelt is only one of like 2 maybe three at most
i recently went back when out downtown with a friend recently and after realizing we hadnt eaten yet decided to try out their menu
so not only is the beer pretty grand and the atmosphere lovely well only when its not crowded  i like to go on weeknights but the grilled cheese and tomato soup is amazing
you heard it here folks
im praising tomatoes for the first time in my life
i have to agree with another yelper that this is one of the only clubs i like in scottsdale
ended up here randomly one night while a few friends and i were in the area and low and behold
live music you cant get much better than live music
why the hell did no one drag me to ticoz before now
seriously you all call yourselves my friends
im disappointed and saddened everyone kept this secret to themselves
thats some damn good bruschetta
for those of you that are not a fan of the tomato persuasion you know how comforting it is lately to see bruschetta that does not contain tomatoes
not only does postinos offer great alternatives they are divine
my favorite by far though is the one with pistachios though i devoured them all
second fave roasted red bell pepper
okay need to stop thinking about that
already had breakfast and am craving food again
central farmers market has become my main source of groceries and supplies for nearly the past year and i cant give this place enough stars
i am so in love with the experience and the quality of items that i get sad weekends i have to miss it and go to a typical store
it really bums me out to not chat with all the booths enjoy my shine latte or arnold palmer im the one that walked around with that pink one like all summer try out some stuffs and find locally sourced foods to cook meals with the entire week
passionfruit  coconut  cupcake  decadent mouth party
i cannot believe it took me this long to try some short leash dogs
right now i am consuming a combination of raspberry tart pomegranate and birthday cake yogurt mixed with coconut pineapple and walnuts
completely running into this place by accident without the aid of friends or yelp reviews i am overwhelmingly pleased that i not only found a place i enjoyed that night but for many occasions to come
i ended up scavenging for lunch a little later than usual today and wanted something light and thats when i saw the new yogurt place on mill ave offered smoothies
while the outside still looks temporary i assure you the inside is filled with happiness and kindness
and yumminess
abridged
this is definitely a south scottsdale hidden gem that has turned into one of my favorite places to grab lunch during the work week
i was hesitant to visit moira after mixed reviews and a friend that got sick on a recent visit
but i had two hours to kill and a craving for fish and so here i ended up
having been to salty on several occasions for lunch and happy hour it definitely deserves more than the 3 its been averaging
im not the worlds biggest italian food fan
mainly because most common establishments just up the tomato and call it pasta without being creative
i have to admit i never thought id ever step in this place either let alone review it with four stars but i am and all thanks to a pasta loving friend and an indecisive day
ive only been to tuck shop once after having dreamed of how amazing it would be and never finding myself in the area which i think is the only real drawback
its never in my line of sight so to speak and i occasionally only remember it when its not convenient to go
that is also part of the charm though
how can you not seriously love this place for real
i dare any of you to tell me otherwise and then i will make fun of you and call you lame
ive been to lolos several times and its about time i inform everyone of their amazing treat of chicken and waffles
and the red koolaid
dont deny it
i dont care if you are 75
you still crave you some koolaid every now and then
and now you can have it
with dinner
and mom and dad cant even yell at you
ive passed sidebar on several occasions but entered the establishment with a group of about 10 for the first time last night as the 2nd half of the last part of my birthday festivities
i walked out happy which means it was a success
talk about awesome
i always manage to forget this place is nearby
it took seeing a jimmy johns to stop in the plaza and remember it the other day and a few days later as a friend and i were both low on groceries we decided to head over
its one of her favorite places to go and as soon as we walked in i could see why
you are the best place i ever discovered on my own
i first came across yucca when searching for a great karaoke place in tempe
i ended up finding rockaroke which has since then been my fix since i have no time for a band
okay lux i can move you up a star
im still not a fan that most of the time its hard to find a seat and have it be quiet enough to focus on anything
additionally i am sad that my favorite shoe chair that was an important part of an evening i had with tony a
seems to no longer be there
some friends never steer me wrong when it comes to deliciousness
imagine for a minute that youre waiting in a really long line
no its not the line ride
you see a menu on the wall with your ordering options but before you are anywhere near someone that could take your order youre yelled at
in todays episode of i cant believe i havent yelped that yet i get to tell you about my go to sushi joint hana
this may be one of the most romantic restaurants in phoenix but there was nothing romantic about the way i devoured my food today at coup des tartes and i mean that in the nicest way possible
where do you even start with sweet republic
this was also one of the first places i found upon moving to the valley with the help of a flyer i received at an event
it is quite a drive for me but always worth it
i will begin by saying that ive been wanting to try this place for months now simply because they have a salad that bears my name
which reminds me of my high school days when the internet was new and i spent an afternoon with a friend visiting websites that also had our name
most ended up being adult sites but toniacom was an asian company that had my name written in a fantastic logo
i wonder what it means
holy hell
how is this vig so much better than the other one after visiting for the first time yesterday i was angry at myself for waiting so long to make it there
did you think the vig could get any sexier well it can
its called the vig uptown
when it was freezing ass cold outside yesterday and i was in my jacket hat scarf and sweater the outdoor area was a dream come true
the fire and a cup of coffee was the perfect ending
as always the staff is great
yay  i love this place
a friend and i visited malees on main a few weeks ago on a whim after ending up in scottsdale
i greatly enjoy thai and absolutely expect good atomosphere in a place as well and i got that at malees
if you ask my friends how long it took me to decide on just one breakfast item the day we visited local breeze for smunch you will understand why i will try this place again
the menu looked fantastic
in the end i had to go with the local breeze omelet but several items including the french toast were tempting
i love sushi
i love sakana
first off their sushi is typically on point
ive only ever had one item i disliked and thats the seabass
not a fan
one item thats a must have is their house smoked salmon nigiri
holy effing awesome
i always want to eat like a dozen orders of that stuff
i have to admit that reading the vast range of reviews for my florist made me debate giving them a 3 for inconsistency but i decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and rounded my 35 up to a 4
its almost hard to believe we all ate at the same establishment
hi windsor
i think id like to keep you
this place gets even more wonderful every single time
ive ventured into nearly all of the menu by now and all of the items i want to try
when theres a lot of different things on the menu that interest my tummy thats a good thing
dont lose that part of you
fe rocks its rightsized
once you get a feel for it you will begin to wonder why other grocery stores are so huge when you can find 98 of what you need at this cute little market
their premade lunches are typically the main part of my weekday diet as is their oatmeal and containers of pineapple
this was hands down my favorite hangout when i lived in akron
it was a few miles from my house and down an old back road smack dab in the middle of gorgeous scenery
there is a very large indoor area to sit as well as a large outdoor area as well and a pond and vineyard on site
sick of the same old thing for breakfast then you need to head here
do not waste another minute unless its evening then go to bed now so you can get up early tomorrow
i have to say i have been to four peaks probably at least 15 times in the past 10 months ive lived in phoenix
thats pretty bad
but also shows how awesome four peaks is
abridged
i never wouldve thought that over a year later i would be coming back to update my thai rama review but i feel it needs to be said
especially after visiting another thai restaurant in the area last night and realizing it doesnt even come close in comparison
the only thing i hate about this place is how many times i should be going there for lunch and forget about it
i cant even begin to say how needed the crescent ballroom was in phoenix
its about time we had a nice amazing small music venue where i can see all my favorite bands and not break the bank
i can even try out bands i havent heard before
all in an intimate setting where i can be so close to ra ra riot that my photos make me look as if i was part of the press
copper star is where i go to buy drip coffee to make at home
and where i meet up for coffee on weekends and evenings with friends
when you can find parking though i prefer walking or biking the atmosphere there is so relaxed you cant help but sit and unwind for a few
does anyone even go to a dive bar to get spectacular service
even when its empty
the topic of mrs whites would frequently come up in the office place by a coworker who used to work near there at the new times
this past week though it came up quite often often enough that on monday when we were planning our lunch out together for thursday we were so hungry by talking about mrs whites that it only took until shortly after 11 for us to pile in her car and head out for some good ol soul food
pho da lat was a great impromptu lunch decision on a saturday afternoon when i had an hour or so to kill with a friend
2pm on a saturday almost no one was in there which i like
thats a wrap turns me into a vegetarian nearly every time i go
and i get hit on by hipster waitresses
i also cant believe ive never reviewed this place until now
ive been here twice for lunch on a friday
both times i left happy
i would come back again if asked
im sure those that know me are not surprised my first review is of solo cafe
i can say without a doubt that its pretty much my second home
hurray for another pizza place i can go to when i actually have a craving which is rare
boo for it taking way too long to try this joint out
sad face
top things to know about dd
warning do not attempt to eat this on a day you are watching your diet
however everyone needs an off day dont they
the place is plain and simple genius
dropped by here for a quick lunch with a friend and was delighted by their choice of salads
i got a small container of salad for under 5 dollars that would be the perfect light lunch
strong votes for their apple coleslaw which they top with dried cranberries and a wedge of crispy pita bread
the 5star rating goes to their home fries if youre getting something that doesnt come with them you need to get a side order
great lunch spot when youre looking for something a bit more fancy but still casual
they assign you seating and then send you off to the counter to admire all of their offerings order and pay
their soups are always fantastic and the sandwiches have quality ingredients
all my friends rave about the duck sandwich but i usually go for the roasted veggie
love lavenue i rarely go though because of the courage it takes to brave the line outside for the winter
cafe castel is an awesome spot be it for a quick coffee to go a catch up with an old friend or a solo coffee  study session
yummy food awesome selection and a really fresh atmosphere makes for a place youre sad to leave
charming shop in little italy
this place is amazing
im just chiming in with all the other reviewers here to say that this is where youve gotta go for a fun evening with friends
you can actually talk to everyone there enjoy your company and wake up the next morning at a human time because you didnt exhaust yourself
love marche and have since i went as a kid to their location in singapore
every dish we tried was cooked to perfection with such a complex and subtle flavouring
its flavours that you cant even imagine until theyre dancing along your palette
yum yum yum
amazing place for lunch
the standard for decor and atmosphere for montreal dumpling places is unfortunately low
harbin shines out as a beacon within a land of despair with its stylish and cool interior
stumbled upon this place when i was looking for a brunch place with some good vegan options egg allergies make brunch very tricky
forget every flavourless taco soggy burrito and unauthentic mexican meal you have ever chocked down
youre free of it all for you now have wilburs
la brigade is quite the institution among the interns at my office
was excited to try this spot out as soon as it opened after seeing the menu for their different locations
stepping into sel gras in the middle of a cold windy montreal evening you feel the low warm lighting wash over you as you slowly start to thaw
the waiter was quick to seat us at a lovely booth thankfully it was a slow monday night or i doubt the 2 booths are free often where we sunk into the welcoming leather
the ambience was really created by their fantastic music
here is a short list of why isshin is perfect
i wanted to update on my review after revisiting misoya and redact my suspicions of the broth not being 100 vegetarian
i confirmed with the staff and they do use a different vegetarian broth
the ramen was just as fantastic and i cant wait to go back
love this place
yes yes yes
if youre looking for lunch downtown then no worries because your search is over
wanted to update to 5 stars my last review was based on takeout and just had a chance to experience their ambience
absolutely fantastic service and beautiful interior
would strongly recommend for anyone looking for quality indian food
great place
this cafe is absolutely beautiful
once walks into the incredible warm atmosphere and a delicious soothing smell
the furniture is charming and makes me want to go back and try out all the different nooks and crannies so i can claim a favourite spot
kantapia is great for what it is  a quick eats restaurant in a student area
i tried their latte and it was really great
the gelato looked great  but i didnt have a chance to try it just yet
the seating was comfy  nothing special
extensive menu
charming little place smack in the mcgill ghetto with an incredible menu and selection
their food was fantastic and the presentation is really charming
the nachos are a must try
we were a big group and were served well and they even told us that the tip had already been included which was very decent of them
heavenly pasta that it perfect to get as a take out dinner so you can sit at home and enjoy food that you could only dream of making try their ravioli its perfection
solid bubble tea place
thaiphon is this great little shop on union  really close to mcgill university
ive been going to guru lukshmi since they had their stall in the newin centre way back when i wasnt even in high school yet
i ordered delivery from nonya and was delighted by their yellow curry and my dining partner was absolutely in awe by their rendang curry
both were light flavourful and a delight to savour
the restaurant looked promising when we sat down
the terrase looked cute and was really energetic
the menu was expansive and they had a special menu du jour with an extra selection of plates
their whole menu is delicious and seriously affordable
i would reccomend their maccheese to go the restaurant is small and they play mtv music on the tv very loudly so i would say order the food to go and enjoy it in a calmer setting
the service is consistently friendly
ive returned a few times since my last review and i must say wow
if youre an indian food fan and are looking to try something new then you should definitely check out thanjai south indian food is a completely unique flavour profile then what you might try at your standard indian resto in montreal like maison du cari or le taj which serve up north indian fare
really delicious pizza  you can tell that they put care into the ingredients they use which is great
the sauce is really fantastic and they have great options on the menu
just an incredible dining experience
chez jose is a quaint little shop with a charming menu
the service is quick and filled with smiles
i tried the cafe au lait which was absolutely wonderful and paired perfectly with a fresh apple turnover yum
would recommend for just a yummy pastry to go or a sweet catch up with a friend
definitely going back
popped in here for a quick morning coffee and was completely charmed by the interior
what a beautiful place i wish i had the time to sit and sip my latte because the cafe is just gorgeous
latte was perfection and the bluberry scone was no less
would definitely recommend and am desperate to go back
vegetarians this is your place
love the interior  it has this warm and lush atmosphere that is so comforting in the winter
the food is absolutely delicious and the service is so sweet and attentive
china garden has been a post airprot pickup ritual with my family for the last 10 years
the food is just phenomenal and its definitely the beat hakka chinese spot in the gta
the only downside is their unattractive seating avoid the washrooms which is why i didnt give them a 5 star rating
if youre vegetarian and confused by the menu ive written my familys tried and loved menu
if you want to visit heaven ive found the address and its 546 avenue duluth
i was delighted by their menu and the warm lighting in the restaurant
the service was fantastic the whole way through and our server didnt rush us even though we took our own sweet time
holy muhamarra
its a fun place to shop
all your meals start off with a fresh salad with a heavenly dressing it has cheese in it yum
and then they bring you fresh warm bread even more yum
i was very pumped to try out ganadara after all the reviews and drooling over the pics of the food on yelp
nice place to go if you want to grab a drink and shoot some pool
i think its 150 per game
my date paid for them but i believe thats what the bartender said
will definitely return here when im in a billiards mood
came here to see a friend sing and really enjoyed the whole experience
this place has a wonderful atmosphere  both upbeat and intimate at the same time
i tried one of the cocktails  it was on the stronger side so i admit i didnt finish it  but the red wine i had two glasses of by suggestion of a friend was fantastic
the food was also really good  i had the eggplant parmesan and much to my lament i forgot to take a picture of it before i ate it  delicious  this is one of the few places in town that features jazz musicians on a regular basis so if you like that vibe this is the place for you
a friend and i visited here after a long day out in death valley
we were tired and starving i had the black bean burger fantastic with tofu fries and the acai blueberry smoothie
everything i had was delicious and i devoured it
my friend had the sweet potato fries  good but i was glad i got the tofu fries im a lifelong vegetarian so i love tofu
the food is good and the people who work there are super nice
will be coming back here again
cool place  from the outside it doesnt look like much but once you get inside its fantastic
i literally could not stop staring at the sparkly nightsky screen they have on the ceiling
the whole place is hawaiian  caribbean themed right down to the shrunken heads and fountains along the walls
the drinks are yummy and the bartenders are super nice
it gets busy and loud but thats to be expected with a venue like this
theres a big clam shell thats also great for taking pictures
all around one of the most fun bars ive ever been to
i appreciated the vegan options here  had the seared polenta and enjoyed it  and overall had a good experience when i came for happy hour with a group of people for a birthday celebration
i only have two small complaints the food and drinks took a really long time to get to us and the frightened doggy running around the place i agree with another reviewer  not sure this is legal in a restaurant
but the guy who waited on us was one of the chefs and was not only a great guy but remembered the name of every person in our 15 person group and there were no problems keeping track of our various tabs
itll be interesting to see what happens with this place
its near the office where my work is based so ill likely be back with coworkers at some point
ive never had a drink here really ive only come here to play pool with my boyfriend and its been a pretty quiet place in my experience
i like that a lot honestly
sometimes i just want to chill and play pool instead of being mobbed by loud noises and crowds and this is a place thats great for that
not a gourmet dining experience but the service is great and the food is delicious  i had their fruit pancakes and they are soooo good
im a healthy eater so i didnt use the butter or syrup i was given
they were perfect as they were with tons of fruit baked into them
ive also come here and gotten dinner as well
yummy veggie burger
ill definitely be back again
i came here late night with a couple friends to have a drink eat and hang out
i love that they have the black bean burger to substitute in for any of the meat burgers on their menu  the waitressbartender we had made me a delicious cocktail and was courteous throughout our stay
the food was delicious and the staff let us stay way after closing  thanks for helping to make my short phoenix trip all the more pleasant
id never been to a cafe rio before so i went here with a couple of friends last month and wow  im definitely a fan  i love mexican to start with but i really enjoyed eating here
the vibe is cool too  love the colorfully painted chairstables
since this location is further from where i live ill likely not be back to this one unless i happen to play a gig in this part of town but ill definitely be back to cafe rio
i spotted this place a few weeks ago im new in town and couldnt wait to return when i ran out of my soy protein because they had a ricebased protein that id tried and loved before
they have a fantastic selection of protein powdersbars and supplements
their prices on protein powder are lower than what ive seen on amazon at least for the one i was looking for and i agree with another reviewer about the associates  they are helpful without being pushy
very important in any store but especially here where there are so many comparable products and its vital to have someone who can help you with your individual needs and not talk you into buying something that you dont really wantneed
i didnt really utilize that since i knew what i wanted but i did notice it with other customers who were there at the same time as i was
definitely coming back here  thank you vegas discount nutrition
this place wouldve gotten that fifth star if their lunch menu had more on it that was vegetarian
that being said the cremini mushroom and egg dish i had was very good and very filling
it doesnt look like a lot of food but it was more than enough for me
i couldnt finish it
the service here is also excellent
the servers really take care of you
i did not run out of water until the very last moment after we paid the checks and were about to leave
i had a hard time finding it because its easy to get lost in caesars palace but its worth wandering around for
im definitely not a fast food person especially being a vegetarian but i was super hungry after playing a show here at the excalibur one night and went with my band members
lo and behold they have a veggie burger  so i ordered that and tater tots
enjoyed everything i got  its a fun oldfashioned vibe
the dance routine that the staff has to do was ehhh
i could tell they werent into it
i would probably feel silly doing it too
but still a good experience
definitely consider this a food option if im in that casino
i had the spinach enchilada and it was delicious  the service my friends and i received here was also great
the server was very friendly and attentive
if i lived in phoenix id likely be back here
only small complaint wish they had more for vegetarians
what a terrific experience  we had a fantastic teppanyaki chef who was both entertaining and dazzled me with his tricks as he cooked our tables food  which tasted amazing
ive been here a few times since i first went in december and ive enjoyed it every single time
i love love love the vegetarian options available here
ive been to their other locations in town but this one has the added benefit of not being on the strip and its closer to where i live
the service is always great and the food is always delicious
ive tried different things on the menu and can vouch for everything ive tried
ive never had one of my friends not enjoy what they had either
this will be a frequent haunt and ill be sure to bring people vegetarian or otherwise back to enjoy one of my favorite restaurants in vegas
i havent been to the other sprouts locations in town as this one is the closest to me but ive been here several times
i cant say ive noticed the pasttheexpiration items mentioned in other reviews then again i dont buy refrigerated items at this store
i generally go here when they have sales on produce
and when they have sales on organic produce say no more  im there
i do appreciate the entire stores selection really
they have a lot of items that you wont find at walmart or even smiths
the workers here have always been friendly and as long as i live in this part of town ill keep coming back to this particular branch
amazing food and great music provided by some friends of mine  ive been here a couple of times but finally had the chance to eat this time around
i had their eggplant parmesan and spaghetti combination plate  yum yum yum  the prices are a little on the high side for my usual but its totally worth it
romantic intimate venue with delicious food  and fantastic service  will definitely return here
went to the restaurant here with a few of my gal pals for a later dinner and really enjoyed the experience
all of the servers and staff members i interacted with were very friendly and courteous
i had the tostada salad and it was very yummy
i wish there were more vegetarian options but if i come back here ill be happy to have that same salad again or one of the other couple of meals
prices are great too
not much to eat here thats vegetarian but thats my only small complaint here
the servers are courteous and attentive and the whole place has a very fancy atmosphere to it
its not stuffy though  there are couches  lounges on one side of the restaurant where you can gather round with your friends and relax while youre eating on the other side are traditional tables
the drinks are fantastic the food is delicious and i cant wait to come back again
very cool venue  i saw a show here a few weeks ago
my only complaint is that for standing room only
obviously this is a steakhouse so it goes without saying that this place isnt built for vegetarians
however i enjoyed what i had  broccoli green beans and some mac and cheese
the service was excellent as was the wine the bread provided and the birthday cake they made for my boyfriend
the look of the place is the coolest part though especially from the outside looking in
its located inside a mall and words cant quite describe the architecture of the structure the restaurant is in but its neat and adds to the experience
not a ton of vegetarian options but i had their veggie fajitas and they didnt disappoint
the service was great and the place has a nice vibe to it
the only thing that surprised me was when one of the typically strip photographers approached my friend and i and asked if we wanted pictures
were locals and just friends so
no thanks
i thought this locale mightve been off the strip enough to escape that phenomenon but apparently not
im not irritated by it actually my friend and i thought it was funny
anyway a solid choice for mexican food in town im sure ill be back at some point
yesterday i had breakfast here with a friend and really enjoyed the experience
the restaurant itself has a very rustic feel  not very las vegas think more along the lines of colorado or even somewhere in the midwest
very cool if youre looking for a place that isnt going to be full of tourists or alcohol
again very nonvegas  but thats part of its draw
there isnt much here for vegetarians but i had their portabello mushroom sandwich and sweet potato fries  both of which i enjoyed
the waitress was attentive and courteous and my friend and i were well taken care of
a lot of reviews talk about breakfastbrunch
we went for dinner but i might return at some point to try other meals
ive never had any food here but the drinks are great and the jazz is awesome  ive seen two of the lovely ladies who perform here and have met most of the musicians  as i am one myself  making great musical vibes from 10 pm until 2 am
the lounge itself has an intimate ambiance which is perfect for jazz
take your date here your best friend or your family  its a great place for any and all
as my first foray into las vegas pizza i was extremely happy with this place  our waiter was extremely diligent and courteous even got basketball scores for my dad who was curious about how his favorite team was doing and checked on us frequently
we got a salad with pear tomato and mixed greens  very very delicious  and a large pizza with onion and green pepper  also very delicious  brick oven style pizza is my favorite  i just love that certain taste
and thats what youll get here
the cool thing is the kitchen is in an open alcove so you can actually see the oven and the workers making your pizza
this place just has a really nice atmosphere
even though theres a bar and tvs my dad and i didnt have to shout to hear each other
i look forward to bringing friends here when i return
a friend and i ended up eating here since my iphone needed repaired and the store was pretty much right next door and we were in the mood for thai anyway
this place has a cool vibe and the barwine rack provide some nice touches as well
the food itself came pretty quickly and was very delicious
the servers were quite courteous
i never got to the bottom of my water glass
we didnt get to experience the live musician other reviewers mention but well be back at some point to this venue
a restaurant where everything is veganvegetarian  omg yes
so much yes
i cant remember what i had since my date ordered for me but it was so good
i met chef kenny as well and hes a sweet guy
the server was very attentive and friendly and took good care of us
i look forward to coming back here many times
dont know how many times i passed this restaurant by as a relatively new local but no more  i went here with a friend recently and the experience was  for the most part  great
being a vegetarian its always awesome to find an entire portion of a menu devoted to vegan or vegetarianfriendly items but gardein  love love love
i got a gardein chicken sandwich and it was delicious
delicious
consistent
do not expect good customer service they never smile and always rush you and can be forgetful with drinks
singapore rice noodles are delicious havent had a dish this good since my dads cooking
this place friggin awesome
they no longer have that delicious waffle cup
do not expect good customer service they never smile and always rush you and can be forgetful with drinks
delicious food
friendly faces  if you dont eat too much rice and curry you could get the smaller bowl for 23 less
its still plenty
think if it like a panda bowl
lol  enjoy
russell came out to our table and started mixing up sauces for us
he and the wife make it a very friendly location
food is great portions are great came with the korean mini dishes as well
its a smaller business no more than 15 tables and the outside at the least at night is a little dark and shady feeling
but inside is delicious food with family who greet you with smiles and open hearts
good food and service
we had the brooklyn bridge pizza and it was delicious one note dont order their bloody marys just go for beer and wine
the bloody marys are from a mix and they dont even have tobasco to spice it up
who isnt a fan of yummy ice cream ghirardellis is great in san francisco and its also great in las vegas if you need a sweet fix head over there they will definitely make sure to give you your sugar fix
really great pastries in charlotte i had a chocolate croissant and some other treats that i cant remember the name of
my sister had the bread pudding which was filled with coconut raisins and pecans
that was to die for they serve it warm which it takes a minute to heat up but still worth  the wait  their prices on pastries werent bad the highest priced items were their bigger items like the muffins for aroundclose to 5
the decor in the shop was very unique there wasnt one thing the same
the shops tables and chairs are vintage and so are the decorations
overall its a great place to go to study or have desert
plus they are open 24hrs would defiantly go back and try something different
first off this place is great to go for a chimney cone but it is not in the food court
its up the stairs away from the food court in the corner
when you walk in there are 2 other businesses inside so make sure your in the right line
i ordered the original cone vanilla ice cream with a regular doughnut cone 7 with cinnamon and sugar on the outside
the employees were very friendly it was my first time trying one so i didnt want to get an extravagant one and not like it
but i loved it and would definitely go back to try their other flavors if im ever back in the area
i would love to see more of these in the us
i will first start off by saying i give it 4 stars because i found the brisket spud a tad spicy but im a baby when it comes to spicy
im not sure if the brisket was supposed to have a lot of fat on it but felt like pieces in my potato had more fat than usual
i would only recommend that they let guests have the option to put on their own sauce on the spud other than that it was excellent
kinda reminded me of texas bbq which is hard to duplicate
very good portions for the price you pay
very busy place even for lunch on a saturday
the line was out the door and took about 1015min to get through it
the place of course was packed and very rambunctious in other words loud
parking may be difficult if the restaurant is busy packed
they also had a country store to the side where you could buy sauce or beef to cook your own
very good tacos and burritos  went for my sisters 21st birthday the waiter was very helpful and patient with us she even brought out our cake for us from the freezer with a candle the plates were very reasonably priced 12 for my carne asada tacos
they were a little bit spicy but im a baby when it comes to spicy
the drinks were reasonably priced too for a cocktailcosmo 8 with their mid grade liquor
we had an overall great experience
would definitely go back
i love cowfish  the staff at this location were very nice my waitress whitney was very patient with my party and i  there was a couple other waiters that were very courteous to us while we ate and enjoyed our time
i didnt catch their names but the staff was awesome
would definitely visit this location again
the food is excellent every time i go
reasonably priced my firecracker roll was a good portion for 17 had edamame as an appetizer for 6
first off i can start by saying loved the view of charlotte at this restaurant  bar we ate in the section where it is first come first serve
for the dining area you have to have a reservation in order to sit and eat no exceptions
we ordered the nachos 14 and steam buns 14
the nachos were very filling but good basically chips with cheese green onion and bacon loaded on top
the sticky buns were good too they had a type of brisket inside with veggies
one of them was a little soggy the bottom
we were celebrating my sisters birthday and our waiter hannah brought her a birthday surprise a ice cream sundae
very nice of her
they do have plenty of tvs to watch any sports game on
will definitely come back for the views
this is a casual place with some high end food
the pizza was delicious and although it wasnt the normal nyc pizza flavor it was still good
what a place
they always have the biggest djs and great party atmosphere
the prices are high but you sre paying for quality
this place is awesome
solid 4 star place
this is definitely a hidden gem off the strip in old vegas
im reviewing this having been to emerils  at the mgm grand a few years ago and it looks like based upon reviews from other yelpers that it has gone down hill
thats a shame because my experience was fantastic
the mgm grand was my first experience staying in las vegas and i have to say for the first time it didnt disappoint
the food was incredible foi graes was to die for
i wish i could have it everyday unfortunately sf bans it
i went here for dinner two nights in a row the food and service was impeccable
hands down the best mediterranean food in tempe if not the valley  super flavorful and authentic
plus the employees are very friendly and helpful
the eggplant and falafel are my favorite things there
all of the hummus is delicious
so many options to choose from
we visited eggspectations twice on during our trip to montreal
we would have gone every morning if we could have it was that good
it was recommended in the montreal guide i had purchased
great tasting food great presentation very friendly staff
was in town for ces  this place was magnificent
the bone in ribeye was one of if not the best that ive ever had
104 avis déjà4 aston besoin dajouter un 105ième avis
alors jai adorétellement que je suis allé 2 fois en 10 jours
les assiettes tournent autour de 11 à 14 pour la majoritébiensûre il y en a des plus fancy et plus dispendieuseset des assiettes de tacos seulement moins cher
la place est simple et coloré et cest tant mieux comme ça
il y a un petit marché dans le resto avec des produits mexicains

bouteille de vin blanc du québec à 28
les entrées offertes et le bar à salade etait excellent des crevettes une bonne salade cesar salade de fruit de mer légumes salades variées
je nai malheureusement pas vu de homard ou du crabe
peut être quil y en a pas en début de semaine et cest pour cela que cest moins cher bref les plats chaud jai été déçu
il manquait un peu de variété
au menu roti de boeuf  poulet purée de pommes de terres  pommes de terres
saumon crevettesriz
saumon crevettes pâtes et cest environs ca que je me souviensm  pâtes une sorte à éviter pas de goût et trop cuites
jai adoré le saumon et le sauté au crevettes
wow super concept nourriture locale avec saveurs du monde
presque tout vient des fermiers près du resto
et le chef prépare cela avec des saveurs du monde comme par exemple de la nourriture avec une touche mexicaine indienne péruvienne etc
le staff est très sympathique et courtois
jai eu la chance de parler avec la manager et elle ma dit que le menu change souvent
jadore et les plats ne sont pas trop cher
à conseiller absoluement si vous passet par la petite ville de ormstown
belle ambiance
le staff est très sympathique

on peut donc bien attendre dans ce parc sans problème car nous donnons notre nom à un employé du resto et il nous appelle quand la table est prête
je vais être honnête jai juste été le jeudi et ça vaut le coup
open bar pour les filles toute la nuit pour un cover de 8 avec guestlist et 12 je crois sans

un des meilleurs sandichs que jai mangé á mtl ils sont bon et pas cher beaucoup de choix de viandes
ils sont tellement populaires quil est préférable appeler avant pour commander

29 pour un menu trois service
laissezmoi vous dire que le service y était  au menu terrine avec gelé de fruit comme plat principal osso buco boeuf ou saumon et comme dessert mousse au chocolat ou une sorte de bavarois dans de la crème anglaise
toujours une ambiance de feux le mercredi ça coûte 6 pour les filles et les jeudis 10 incluant le filet mignon on aime ça  sur réservation
cest bon cest cheap et cest un avv  jai mangé dans les restos indiens aux alentours et cela reste mon préféré  essayez le poulet au beurre il est délicieux
jy suis allée en février dernier et retourné en avril
jadore la bière artisanale de ce brasseur de quartier
ils ont quand même beaucoup de choix et ce que jai adoré cest le fait que les deux fois que jai été leur menu de bière avait changée
le staff est très amical et connaissent bien leur bières
si jamais on est pas sûre de notre choix ils peuvent toujours nos offrir un verre de dégustation
le plus beau provigo que jai vu de toute ma vie ah ce quil est charmant imaginezvous arriver au stationnement avec une musique dambiance pour faire lépicerie
et on rentrenon ce ne sont pas les tomates les laitues en spécial quon voit en rentrant mais le comptoir à gâteau où il y a toujours des petits échantillons gratuit
et ensuite un stand où ils font des jus frais où biensûre nous pouvons y goûter aussi
entre les gâteaux et les jus il y a souvent très souvent des chanteurs ou un petit band de musique de 23 personnes et jamais les même
vive la diversité
le comptoir à viande est fabuleux surtout pour les bbq lété il y a du choix et du choix déjà mariné
tout dans le magasin est bien placé
le staff est amical
bref si tous les super marché était comme cela jy passerai la journée
cest clairement une attraction à faire à stsauveur
tellement bon

jadore ce méga bar
que ce soit pour une soirée relax ou bien aller voir un match ou la boxe ou ufc ce bar pourra nous accueillir comme il faut
les serveuses sont fines
lalcool nest pas trop cher
ils ont des 4 litres de bière la bud est pas cher mais nest pas bonne mais frappe pareil
on peut réserver aussi lors des évènements
on peut manger pour pas cher aussi
je suis retourné au cinko wow quel différence de la première fois nous avons commandé un plat de tacos une poutine et le hotdog avec macaronie au fromage
le tout délicieux le service super rapide
et ce nest pas chère
je cherchais un endroit à proximité de où jétais pour déjeuner vers 14h un dimanche
et bien yelp et les yelpeurs mont aidé à faire mon choix
je nai pas été déçu
des bons déjeuner traditionnel avec une montagne de bons fruits frais
étant très traditionnel comme personne jai pris un plat classique 2 oeufs et saucisses
cela vient avec les super patates du café et une montagne de fruit
la serveuse très sympatique aussi
jy retourne cest sûr et certain
mon amie à pris le plat doeufs bénédictines mexicains
jai été un jeudi 5à7
de plus soir de match
il ny avait pas beaucoup de monde et alors mais au courant de la soirée ça cest rempli
il y avait un dj alors de la bonne musique durant les pauses du match
beaucoup de spéciaux sur les drinks
ce bar est parfait pour manger des mix indiensquébecois
bref jai bien aimé pour un 5à7
mon copain a voulu me faire essayé ce resto quil connaissait
il faut absolument essayé les rouleaux de homard tempura
wow un vrai délice et une belle découverte
on a partager 2 plats
soit une grillade mixte et un plat de sushi du chef
le tout était excellent
depuis que jai une bff russe jai toujours adoré la bouffe russe
par contre je navais jamais essayé la nourriture russe dans un resto et cesr au giorgia que ça sest passé
plus gros que celui du plateau et aussi bon
service rapide et confort food pas cher
par contre attendezvous à attendre longtempson était 2 dimanche soir vers 8h et on a dû attendre 30 minutes  mais bon ça vaut lattente
une des plus belle terasse du vieuxmtl selon moi
les gens sont beaux
la vue sur le fleuve est superbe
choix de cocktail pour tous les goûts
quelques choix de plats
mais bref idéal pour allez prendre un verre entre amis  en couple ou en date
contente davoir essayé ce petit resto dont tout le monde parle depuis quelque tempsservice un peu lent
mais lattente en vaut la peine partaagez les plats qui sont en plat principale ou en entrée plutôt que de choisir le spécial à partager
je vous conseille la soupe ramen
depuis des années je voulais essayer ce resto au style diner des années 50
eh bien je suis enfin aller ça faisait une éternité que ça mavait pris une éternité choisir dans le menu
je voulais tout goûter
mes amis et moi avons chacun pris une entrée
jai donc pu goûter aux entrée de saucisses italiennes boulettes de viande et le ravioli
les 3 délicieux mais prochaine fois je prendrai les boulettes ma soeur et son amie ont pris la salade pizzaiole
délicieuse aussi
comment ne pas aimer le mondialadmission gratuiteon peut déguster plusieurs bières à 23 coupons 23 beaucoup de choix  super ambiance et il  y a une terrasse
i came here a few weeks ago for a friends birthday and we had a great time
there was a group of about 10 of us and we had tried to get in a few weeks earlier around 1015 at night and the line was ridiculous as we were keen to go to rock n horses we decided to make a reservation for dinner for my friends celebration
the reservation was for 630 and we were told that we would need to finish our meals by 9 because they would need to move our table off of the dance floor since we were a big group
rock n horses certainly isnt busy early on in the night but there are some definite advantages to arriving early
this is a hidden gem of a restaurant in an area that lacks nearby shopping and other restaurants
i have been going here for about three years now and it is my goto for greek food
i have dined in have ordered take out and have ordered delivery without any issues and without compromising on food quality
it trumps the greek restaurants on the danforth where i find the food can often be too salty and oily
i came here with a friend around 700 on a lovely summer evening
this is one of many local grocery stores and it offers a number if benefits
i came to trattoria mercatto one day for lunch with some relatives who were visiting toronto from overseas
i came here for dinner with two other friends on rock lobsters second or third night open in this location
i came here on a friday night before going out at some of the downtown bars
the environment is relaxed unpretentious and perfect for either afterwork drinks with coworkers or grabbing drinks with friends before going to the downtown clubs
the drinks were cheap  on friday nights pints are 5 or 550 before 10pm and my glass of wine was under 6 including tax
overall good service good vibe and i will definitely return
positanos is a staple in my family with a family member going at least once a week its a very friendly restaurant with a real family feel
it is casual yet nice enough if you want a celebratory dinner
due to the familyfriendly feel children are more than welcome here although you wont see them running around or disrupting things
i came here for lunch with two friends one of whom is both vegan and cannot have gluten and the rest of us are not
we selected windup bird cafe as they are able to cater to all of these dietary needs
i came here for dinner on a saturday night with a group of about 11 people
our server megan was great at handling the size of the party and our various needs as we had a lot of questions and many specific requests for our various meals
this is really a 45 star rating
i came here for lunch with a friend on saturday as we were in the mood for sushi
the restaurant is very small but decorated well
we were welcomed immediately and brought to one of the few remaining tables
as soon as we sat down we were given complimentary green tea salad and miso soup
we had not even opened the menus yet
so far they were starting off very well
i came here with some coworkers for a goodbye lunch
i came here for dinner one evening with my family and had the angel hair pasta dish angel hair with grilled chicken sundried tomatoes red onion roasted garlic in a light olive oilherbed tomato sauce
the dish was very good however i found the sauce to be a bit too salty for my liking
i came here on a lovely summer evening with some friends when moroco had just opened
we had just been out for sushi for dinner and were looking for some place to have dessert
we stumbled across moroco and the fun and girly decor enticed us to give it a try
a group of my friends and i were looking for a place to grab a drink while we were waiting for a table at a nearby restaurant
we saw hair of the dog and were a little skeptical at first glance of the exterior but we were happy with our choice once we went inside
when i was here today i was speaking with who i presume to be one of the owners
he was super friendly and suggested various vegetables for me to try out
he also wanted me to give him feedback on his suggestions the next time im back at his store
again while the produce may not be 100 the freshest the price point and customer service more than compensate
this is my goto health foods store in the city and i will purposely go out of my way to shop there
they have the widest range of products and selection and 95 of the time they have the best prices too
for example there is a type of dried seaweed that i like that whole foods sells for 999 and herbs  nutrition carries it for 699
there is no reason why whole foods should have a 3 markup i will support local independent stores thank you very much
pretty good array of tapas
nice business casual environment
the server was really helpful with suggesting how dishes could be made vegan although im not entirely sure he knew exactly what vegan meant
i got the salad with the sautéed mushrooms
i was a little confused when i received my salad because it initially looked like a massive pile of arugula
i came here on a weekday afternoon for a casual business meeting
there was a wide variety of age groups there and people doing different things  other meetings people studying reading books etc
i had been to sukho thai before for dinner and i had ordered delivery from them before but this was my first time going for lunch
this review will be based on my lunch experience
i came here for dinner on a saturday night and we were not too impressed initially but the food made it worth while
i had never been to an aroma before but decided to try this one out today for lunch with a friend
we arrived around noon and the restaurant was about 50 full
i started to notice that it got pretty busy with the lunch crowd around 1230 so unless youre planning on doing take out it might be a good idea to arrive a bit earlier so you can grab a table
i came here for breakfast around 9 on a sunday morning
it wasnt too busy yet and my friend and i got a table immediately

extra star given for the many vegan menu options
my vegan companion was able to order the vegan chile relleno
i had a taco plate and it was okay
we stopped by for dinner before a show last weekend at the house of blues venue is just a hop down the escalator
very convenient
i had a blackberry splash to drink muddled blueberry tequila and ginger liqeuor very refreshing
last weekend we stopped in to the pink taco for dinner pre show at the joint in the hard rock hotel
it location is within a two minute walk of the venue we were going to for the show
very convenient
the food was really yummy
i had the pink tacos and my vegan companion had the veggie tacos
well be back again next time were in town
jai été là pour prendre un verre après un superbe évènement yelp
étant parti en voyagejen avais entendu parler vaguementmais sans plusen étant dedans je me suis souvenue que cétait the spot ben à la mode donc plusieurs parlent
entre payer 30 pour être satisfait en sushi ou un sushi all you can eatallez là
pour le prix ça vaut le coup et cest un avv  des menus spéciaux pour 2 ou 3 personnes sont intéressant pour y déguster plusieurs variétés
jai été rejoindre des amis làbas après que ma soirée ait déjà commencer il y a quelques heuresje ne mattendais à rien
jai tellement passé souvent devant ce resto et la devanture ne me donnais pas très envie de rentrer dans ce restoet pourtantjaurai dû
mes collègues étaient partant pour aller làet ils étaient 2 alors ils ont gagné la place où il fallait aller dîner
ils mont dit que les portions étaient grossesjétais comme ouicomme dans tous les restos grecquesblablablatsédodu comme je suis  je men étais capable erreur
hey cest un resto pour les gens qui ont faim
on a tous commander lassiettes de gyrosjai mis assiettes avec un s
mmmm la griffintown est très bonne
restobar qui a une simplicité qui fait tout son charme
très illuminé avec un décor au style du quartier
ils ont un menu midi varié de même que leur menu régulier
bref je vous conseille fortement dy aller
trop nice comme endroitavex beaucoup beaucoup beaucoup de choix de boissons alcoolisésmoitié prix sur la bière et les pots massons pendant le 5 à 7
je ne peux pas commenter sur la nourriture car jai été pour prendre des verres
bref une belle ambiance comme griffintown le connais
les proprios super sympa
il y a toute sorte de drink et le décors est tout cute
cest sûre que jy retourne ça sentait trop bon en plus il y a un jardin qui va ouvrir en été jai hâte
je suis aller un samedi vers 6h cétait assez vide
notre serveuse était super
je la voyais regarder de loin pour voir sil nous manquait quelque chose malgré quelle ne parlait pas français
une chance que je travaille à cinq minutes de marche de ce petit local sinon je naurai jamais pu y aller  mais bon  je me sens vip de pouvoir dîner là
ouvert de 11h à 15h du lundi au vendredi pas plus
too bad pour les gens normaux qui ont des horaires du lundi au vendredi et qui ne sont pas dans le coins
deuxième visite à ce resto
dernière fois jai été quand il allait fermé donc je nai pris que 2 platsbref cette foisci jai pu savouver comme il faut
jai pris trois entrées différentes samosas oignons frit et les crevettes pakora
toutes les trois délicieuse
jai pris un thali comme plat pricipal
si vous voulez goûter à un peu de tout je vous le conseille
7 pour un thali en souper et cela inclut le pain naan du riz blanc un morceau de poulet tandori des legumes cuits et un morceau de tomate et concombre et un super bon poulet au beurre
super repas pour moins de 15 chacun  nous étions 2 je suis habitué à aller au punjab palace mais je crois que je vais allet plus souvent là
il y a beaucoup moins de monde dans le sens que cest intime cest un peu moins cher et  cest délicieux et surtout le service est meilleur
on mavait souvent parlé du confessional comme une bonne place pour passer ses soirées à faire le party comme oli primeau du beach club
wow wow wow
un petit coup de coeur dans la ville de beauharnois

je recommande fortement si vous êtes dans le coin
quel jolie petit endroit réconfortant calme et chaleureux
même si je suis arriver 40 minutes avant la fermeture pour y boire un thé dans une journée glaciale la serveuse ma très bien accueilli
la carte des thé est très bien expliqué
je suis tombé sous le charme des petits paragraphe expliquant doù venait le thé quel était le monsieur qui le confectionnait quels types de feuilles étaient utilisé etc etc
jai trouvé la carte des sucreries un peu plate
pas beaucoup de choix et les deux trucs que je voulais manger avec mon ami il ny en avait pas
on sentend quon est arrivé 40 minutes avant la fermeture cest normal
bref cest sûre et certain que je vais retourner à cet endroit pour lire date jaser ou simplement boire un thé en regardant les gens alentours de moi
woww cest beau cest grand cest charmant
même si le bâtiment où est situé la brasserie est un nouveau bâtiment cette place à su garder lendroit digne du quartier griffintown
whattttt jétais sûre davoir fait un avis sur cette pâtisserie
comme plusieurs le saventje naime pas trop les trucs sucrésmais la pâtisserie fait des trucs incroyablement bon
ce que je préfère cest leur fameuse crème brûlée qui est servi dans un plat style terre cuite quon peut garder chez soiyeah
ils ont beaucoup de petits gâteau différentattentionune étoile de moins car le service peut être un petit peu lentet souvent il manque certains trucs car trop populairebref allezy

jétais sceptique à lidée daller dans un bar du vieux port sans talon haut et sans être sur mon 36
mais bref vu que jétais avec un habitué je me suis dit daccord jy vais pour un verre4 verres plus tard ma soirée à fini à la fermeture
le staff est super gentil autant des bouncers qui se pensent pas au dessus de toi que les barmaid et la fille du coatcheck

bel endroit pour prendre un verre beaucoup de choix de boissons ils ont des trucs à grignotter et de la musique live
resto où le service est ultra rapide bon et pas cher
un grand choix de combo et de platsmais ce quil reste de meilleur cest leur fameuse soupe tonki pour nous aider à passer notre dûr hiver  quebecois ou notre hangover du dimancheils font même pour emporter
anticafe un concept à adopter
jen veux plus des endroits comme cela
je suis allée deux fois déjà
premièrement permettezmoi  de vous dire que le staff est superbe
ça fesait longtemps  que je ne me sentais pas aussi bien accueilli  dans un endroit
mettons les choses au clair du concept
à lachat dune boisson juste une boisson alcoolisé ou sans alcool et bien tu peux manger les plats pour la modique somme de 490 chacun
dire quil y a quelques année je détestais la poutine jusquà temps que je découvre les poutines avec autre chose que du fromage en grain et de la sauce brune qui donne ben soif
ah et aussi que je découvre quavec du ketchup la poutine est 1000 fois meilleure
vous êtes tanné de manger du mcdo de la poutine des pointes de pizzas un peu passer date après le club ou bar pas de problème le mon nan est ouvert jusquà 4h comme plusieurs restos du quartier chinois
la bouffe boffpeutêtre car nous étions plus que vingt que toutes les frites étaient froides
bref nous navons pas tripper sur la bouffe
un menu simple
hotdog poutine et frites
pas de place pour sassoir
sauf à lextérieur où il y a des tables à piquenique dans un parking entre les ruelles de stmichel et vous aurez une super belle vue de la brasserie sketch den face
sinon vous pouvez manger debout il y a des comptoirs haur
pas cher bonne bouffe grosse bièreendroit idéal pour les évènements sportifs ou pour passer une soirée tranquile entre amis pour pas cher
superbe et grande épicerie
une rangée complète de riz au moins deux rangées de vermicelles une rangée de thé une rangée de champignons secs et en canne ou en sacetc etc
bref il y a de tout même des produits arabes et latinos
jai trouvé du tahini du couscous du quinoa et une variété de tofu avec saveur pour beaucoup moins cher quà lépicerie
je vais y retourner pour la rangée complète de produits pour faire des sushis
oh aussi une variété de feuilles et légumes verts
bref belle découverte
resto donc tout lété jai vu tout lété les renos pour quil ouvreet quand celuici à ouvert jai toujours vu beaucoup de gens à lintérieur
anciennement la cortina resto connu à rdp jai commandé
les plats du genre hamburger frites sont environs 13 txmais vous allez comprendre que cest le hamburger
tse pas relish ketchup mayoils ont tout ils sont gros
moi jai commandé un sousmarinje ne suis pas trop une sousmarin girlmais celui special rottonda avec pleins de sorte de viandeme donnait leau à la boucheet comme de faitmalade
capicolli peperroni et je me souviens plus quoila mayo épicée qui est fournit avec les frites est délicieuse
cest sûre que dès que loccasion ce présente je vais aller manger directement làet en plus ils ont des menus midi
ahhh et le plus foulivraison en moins de 20 min
javais entendu parler de ce fameux cassecroute de cartierville mais je navais jamais été
le choix de poutine y ait
les sandwichs et gyros aussi
vous pouvez commander tout type dhamburger
bref un vrai cassecroute où on sent quon va sortir de là le ventre plein
30 choix de sandwichs
7 325 et le 10 375 tx
que dire de plus cest bon
ils ont des sushis préfaitmais pas supercependant ils ne sont pas chet ey ça depanne
si vous lisez mes reviews vous savez que je suis une fan de bouffe haïtienneet en ayant habité dans le hood et rdpjai essayé pas mal dendroitset même le meilleur cassecroûte au metro jarry
joeys sort of reminds me of a slightly more upscale moxies
the decor is similar the menu items are similar and the waitresses look similar except these ones wear more modest pencil skirts as opposed to the mini skirts that moxies favours
this is a really good find its a small little restaurant with sort of demented decor but the food is excellent
i really wanted to be blown away by this place and it was good but it wasnt the best grilled cheese ever good
perhaps my expectations were high seeing as this place has been featured on shows and is number one for grilled cheese on blogto
okay this is not some fine dinning establishment
this is a diner
not only that but apparently its a 24 hour diner so thats pretty frigging awesome
good to know
those come in handy
you know what for what it is it was pretty good
recognize that its a fast food mexican restaurant but compare to a taco bell this is gold
this place was recommended to be by other shop keepers in the area so i went to check it out
first off the staff is so nice and accommodating
when you walk in it honestly doesnt look like much and the baked goods look sort of generic and plain
dont be fooled
i sort of want to give this place 312 stars but oh well
when i worked in the area we would treat ourselves once every week or two and go here for lunch and just gorge ourselves
i switched jobs and stopped working close by and didnt come back for years
im not kidding i was always sad about that
it just wasnt close
really this deserves a 312 star rating but well just go with this and ill explain
the fish and chips were delicious and flavourful but i cant give 5 stars to fish and chip places that give you little packets of tartar sauce
come on guys step up your game
make your own version
sell it for an extra buck
it would set you apart
we ended up here after we couldnt find a thai restaurant
worked out really well
it was a friday at lunch so we got their fish and chip special
it took quite awhile to bring them all out but basically all of us ordered it so that may have been the reason
the meal ended up being very well priced cheaper than what was listed on their website
not sure if thats because it was lunch or because its just cheaper than what they have listed
food was good and the portions were large
the waiter was very pleasant the the pub itself had a good atmosphere
if im in the area again and need to eat i would totally go again even though its bordering on a pretty sketchy area
this is a fun and fantastic little find in downtown oakville
since my original review i have gone back another few times and been to italy
when i went to italy i was expecting all of the food to be as good as if not better than what i had at alegno
well if we were lucky it was as good
which means im guessing this as good as it gets the food truly is exceptional
you have to go to something like medieval times with an openmind and a sense of fun
also you have to go with a group
this isnt even something to do with a couplealthough i did see it happening
jamie is an awesome host
my bachelorette weekend definitely would not have been the same if it werent for jamie
hes so helpful and honest
me and my girls had a great time in vegas because of him
free video games ranging from classic to current
plus amazing tribute themed cocktails  amazing food
i sure hope this place sticks around for a while
its magical
keith h needs to get his panties out of a twist
do not let his one star rating fool you this place is a gem
i went to the rumbar for the first time yesterday and i was not disappointed
the bar staff was the epitome of mixology
i could have spent a few hours watching them expertly craft drinks alone
they have one drink the shorty that requires lighting a sage leaf on fire then covering it with a glass to add smoke flavor to it
pure genius
whomever came up with these recipes
i applaud you
sung to the tune of hello by adele
seriously so so so so so did i mention so delicious
everything from okra baked ziti chicken and pies
best delivery ever
the dishes we ordered hunan chk and cashew chk were delicious
the crab rangoon had waaaay too much sugar in them
love this place
excellent food great crew great atmosphere chicken and waffles in charlotte
may they never close
seven lives serves up albeit slowly some good west coast style tacos in the heart of kensington
union is a pretty nice bar and grill in suburbia that is not named moxies or earls although the decor of the place will certainly remind you of them
its a union of chiq and suave ambiance with a large space which makes it a good place for a social meet up with friends family or whoever else you meet with
i work in the area and bamiyan is a staple in my lunch rotation
it never fails to offer a good meal
quarter portuguese chicken with 2 sides for 499 dark meat 1 for white
my dad mentioned this hidden gem to me and i decided to drop by during my lunch hour
being a bar in the middle of suburbia its very empty during lunch
best burger place ive had in toronto
hands down
oldies with a chopstick licking good twist great drinks and vibe
dos sesame lamb lamb stuffed pan fried buns beef lung or tripe lamb soup
monastery isnt your typical bakery and deli  it must suffer from the napoleon syndrome because its massive much larger than any typical bakery and deli has a right to be
its actually closer to a small local market
after reading the reviews i had to try this legendary apple cake
first things first
greattttt falafels
5 for a massive eggplant hummas veggie filled falafel sandwich which is literally bursting out of the pita
be sure to get lots of napkins and a fork because youre going to need to plan out how to attack this thing
if you go out in toronto you know about the late night chinese food scene
that greasy stuff that helps sobers you up a bit and hopefully minimizes the hang over the next day although it certainly wont minimize your waistline
great vibe  loud crowd for a game  5 craft brews all the time  passable food menu with a good deal of healthy options to offset all those pints  perfect setting for the game
